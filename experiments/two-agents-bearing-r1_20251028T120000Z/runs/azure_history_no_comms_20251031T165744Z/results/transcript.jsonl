{"turn": 59, "agent_id": "a5", "prompt": "OBJECTIVE:\nChoose exactly one action that maximises team progress toward the goal under partial observability and range-limited communication.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not return any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3. Consult the `adjacent` list; it labels each of the N/E/S/W cells as FREE, WALL, OUT_OF_BOUNDS, AGENT, or GOAL.\n4. Use `recent_positions` (last 5 positions, newest first) to avoid immediate backtracking unless it is the only safe option.\n5. Use `goal_sensor`, `neighbors_in_view`, `artifacts_in_view`, and `inbox` to decide.\n6. If you communicate, send the minimal valid message.\n7. If no safe move exists, prefer STAY over collisions.\n8. Populate `comment` with exactly one paragraph (1-3 sentences) that explains your reasoning for this turn.\n\nDECISION RULES:\n- Precedence: 1) OUTPUT CONTRACT, 2) EXECUTION RULES.\n- Ambiguity: choose the safest valid action.
