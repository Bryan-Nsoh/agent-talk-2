Although there is also a choice to send an INTENT message, it isn't required, and it might be better to just focus on the action itself. Given that moving East is within our movement range and aligns with our goals, I'll finalize the action as moving East with the structured object.**Preparing action output**\n\nI need to reason that moving East is the only safe option that moves us toward our goal. It's important to include the \"comment\" field as a string within the \"final_result\" object. I need to call a function tool before outputting; the instructions say to pick the most relevant one, like `functions.final_result` with the correct payload. Finally, it looks like I shouldn\u2019t output anything else in the assistant's final message, just the final JSON from the call.**Clarifying function usage**\n\nI realize that the tool `functions.final_result` is meant to return the structured payload. The process seems to involve calling the tool with the `final_result` object, then providing a separate final message to the user. The output should be the \"Decision\" object, which means I need to structure my call like this:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" },\n  comment: \"East is the only non-wall option in view, and the goal bearing is to the East; moving East advances toward the goal while avoiding collisions.\"\n}\n\nI must keep the \"comment\" concise but effective within one paragraph.**Emitting structured response**\n\nI need to remember to emit only the structured `Decision` object, which will be the tool's response. In this setup, the final channel will deliver that response. I should call the function in the commentary channel first. After invoking the function, I\u2019ll need to present the final answer. The instructions say I must call a defined function tool immediately. I\u2019ll call `functions.final_result` with the appropriate payload, ensuring I follow the proper steps in the process.**Planning the tool call and output**\n\nI usually need to present the final answer in the \"final\" channel after the tool call. So, the steps are clear: first, I\u2019ll send a call in the \"commentary\" channel with the `final_result` payload. Then, I\u2019ll present the \"Decision\" object in the \"final\" channel. \n\nFor my comment, I want to say, \"East is the only safe free neighbor in view.

The agent is located at row 2, column 2 in a 0-indexed system. Let's visualize the rows, where the first row corresponds to y=6. For example, the patterns show how the agent moves north, reducing y. If we move to the north, the cell at (x=28, y=7) is a free position. I\u2019m also confirming that the east cell at (x=29, y=8) is free too, which is important for evaluating the agent\u2019s movement options.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nI'm figuring out the movement options for the agent. To the east at column 3, there's a free space (''). The south cell (x=28, y=9) is also free, as is the west cell (x=27, y=8). However, there's a wall to the north; the north cell at (x=28, y=6) has a '#,' but the one at (x=28, y=7) is free.

I see that the adjacent cell to the east is free, but I have to think about the possibility of a collision with a goal in that direction. It\u2019s essential to move east toward the goal, but first, I need to ensure I don\u2019t step out of bounds. The grid dimensions are 30, and I\u2019m locating my agent's position, which is at (2,1) in the local patch layout.**Deciding movement direction**\n\nI\u2019m clarifying patch coordinates: the top-left absolute position is (0,0), and A is at (2,2) in the patch grid, while my absolute position is (2,1). There\u2019s some confusion about offsets, but I don\u2019t need to dwell on that. The adjacent statuses indicate that the east and west are free, so I\u2019ll choose to move east toward the goal, which is far to the east. Since my range allows sensing up to two steps away, moving east feels safe. I\u2019ll decide to move EAST.**Framing the movement rationale**\n\nI\u2019m crafting a statement: \u201cI move East to approach the goal because there are walls to the north and south, and moving west would mean backtracking. Since east is the only new safe option within range, this makes sense! The rule advises avoiding immediate backtracking, especially since I just moved from (1,1) to (2,1), and going west would take me back to (1,1), which I should avoid. I\u2019ll finalize the action by calling the function to move East.**Structuring the final result**\n\nI need to format the top-level JSON for the \"final_result\" wrapper correctly. I\u2019ll set \"action\" to { \"kind\": \"MOVE\", \"direction\": \"E\" }. The comment also needs to be included as a property within the final_result JSON. It looks like the structured response format I need is { action: { ... }, comment: string | null }. I\u2019ll make sure to double-check that everything matches the expected structure for each turn in the LLM response.**Implementing the action flow**\n\nIn earlier tasks, the flow involved using the tool to return information, which we then present as the final content. There\u2019s no direct dependency, though; the tool's output gets used to inform the response to the user. So, I\u2019ll call the function in the commentary channel and then present the final decision in the final channel. \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll call functions.final_result with the action set to move east and include a reasoned comment. Once that\u2019s set, I\u2019ll structure the final response with the same JSON format, ensuring direction values are correct, like \"E\" for east.

The adjacent cells are N wall, and E, S, and W are free. It seems the cell above is a wall. Looking at recent positions, the first one is (28, 7) and then (28, 8). So, if the most recent position should match the current, it\u2019s a bit confusing but I see how they list it. The goal sensor has a bearing of \"N\" and strength \"MID.\"**Evaluating the goal bearing**\n\nThe bearing indicates that the goal lies to the north. However, since there\u2019s a wall directly north, I can't progress in that direction. To my east, south, and west, the paths are free. I also need to keep in mind that the neighbors and any artifacts are not in view, and my inbox is empty. With a maximum communication range of 2, I can send a minimal message, like a GOAL_HINT, but it seems like moving might be a priority since going north is blocked.**Mapping obstacles and directions**\n\nThe goal is to the north, but there's a wall blocking the way. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s a path beyond the wall, but I can't see it from here. My movement options are to the east, south, or west, but I need to think about the local obstacles within this patch. I'll map the grid patch starting from the top left at (26,5). Rows 0 to 4 will correspond to y-coordinates 5 to 9, and columns 0 to 4 will be x-coordinates 26 to 30.**Mapping agent's position**\n\nI\u2019m mapping the grid patch to identify where the agent is located. In Row 0 at y=5, the coordinates show walls ('#') at (28) and (30) with free spots around. The agent is at (28, 7), indicated by 'A' in Row 2. Looking north at (28, 6), there\u2019s a wall, so that checks out. To the east at (29, 7) is free, south at (28, 8) is also free, and to the west at (27, 7) is free too. So, I have three directions to move: east, south, or west!**Making a movement decision**\n\nI\u2019m planning my next move based on the goal bearing to the north, but since that direction is blocked, I need to reposition. I can move east to (29, 7) or south to (28, 8), but I need to avoid backtracking. Moving east seems promising since it opens up options to go north eventually, as (29, 6) is free. Though I considered making a goal hint, it\u2019s unnecessary. I\u2019ll proceed with moving east, so my decision will be to move in that direction to maximize progress toward the goal. I'll structure this as a decision object.**Preparing final decision object**\n\nI realize that the final_result expects a structured \"action\" object. It should include both \"action\" and \"comment\" fields. The action specifies the move, and the comment will explain my reasoning succinctly in one paragraph.

So, I need to follow this flow: call the tool first, receive its response, and only then present the final Decision object to the user, ensuring I maintain the proper structure as required.**Understanding task flow**\n\nIn this task, the typical flow involves calling the tool using functions.final_result with the decision object. Once I do that, the next step seems to be responding with nothing extra. However, the system actually expects a final message for the user. The developer's instructions are clear: I must call a tool immediately after the user's request before giving any further responses. So, I\u2019ll call the tool, wait for its response, and then provide the final decision object to the user.**Preparing Decision output**\n\nThe \"OUTPUT CONTRACT\" states that I should return a decision object. I plan to use a two-turn approach, first calling the function final_result with my decision and then presenting the final result. The specification indicates I can only return a structured object that matches the Decision model without any extra text. \n\nSo, my plan is to call functions.final_result immediately with the action and comment detailed in the schema. After the tool responds, I\u2019ll \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 the Decision object as content, maintaining clarity and precision throughout.

The top-left of this patch is at (27,5). I see the layout with each row displaying coordinates clearly. For example, in Row 0 (y=5), I have the characters mapping to specific x-values, with x increasing from left to right. The coordinates are aligned, and I need to confirm that the N from (29,7) accurately corresponds to the patch position at (29,6) from Row 1. It\u2019s important to ensure all details are precise!**Analyzing patch coordinates**\n\nFor Row 1, I see the characters mapped to coordinates, with (29,6) being free. The 'N' direction is open too, as it also shows a free space at (29,8). Looking at the 'W' direction, (28,7) is free as well, although it has an 'A' at (29,7) representing myself. So 'A' is indeed marking my position in this patch. However, moving east is blocked by an out-of-bounds area. I also need to note the goal's sensor bearing, which is Northwest with a medium strength.**Interpreting goal direction**\n\nThe goal bearing indicates that there's a target located to the Northwest of my current position. This is interesting since bearing is relative; I need to consider it based on my agent's orientation, which is South. The neighbor and artifacts in view are empty, meaning I don\u2019t have much information right now. To maximize progress, moving toward the Northwest direction seems appropriate. However, moving diagonally isn\u2019t valid, so I need to select the closest cardinal direction to that bearing to make my next move.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nIn considering my next move, I see that Northwest would involve moving either North or West, but the exact bearing isn't precise. With a medium strength indicating the goal is moderately close, I want to be cautious. My last five positions show movement from (29,7) to (28,7) and then to (28,8). To avoid backtracking, I shouldn\u2019t move to those previous positions. My current options include moving North to (29,6) or possibly West to (27,8) from (28,8) since returning to previous spots isn\u2019t ideal.**Making a decision on movement**\n\nAfter considering the situation, I realize that moving to (28,7) would mean backtracking. The ideal step should avoid revisiting previous positions unless it\u2019s the only safe option. Since moving to (28,8) isn\u2019t possible from (29,7) and I see that multiple directions are open, I think moving North to (29,6) is best. This move aligns with the goal bearing of Northwest and avoids any backtracking. I'll formulate a decision object to reflect this action, noting that it progresses me toward the goal safely.**Clarifying tool usage**\n\nI'm looking to create a structured decision object without unnecessary communication. I don't need to send messages like \"INTENT\" or \"HERE.\" It looks like I should call the `functions.final_result` tool directly since we're only working on a single action. I recall that the tool's output needs to be the decision itself, which means I must call it before delivering my final response to ensure clarity. After the tool returns, I\u2019ll present the required Decision object as the final output.**Crafting the decision object**\n\nI need to create a concise decision object while ensuring it\u2019s structured correctly. The `functions.final_result` tool requires parameters for action and a comment. I plan to move north (\u201cN\u201d), as this direction is free of obstacles and aligns with our goal direction. I\u2019ll formulate a comment that clearly explains my reasoning in 2-3 sentences without including any unnecessary details.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll call the tool with these parameters to ensure the output reflects the final decision.

I shouldn\u2019t immediately backtrack from (4,1) to (3,1) since that would confuse the sequence. The current position is (4,1), which suggests the last move was from there to the previous position. The list indicates the newest position is (4,1), where I came from (3,1). However, the sequence shows a movement pattern that goes from (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1), all moving east along the x-axis.**Considering movement options**\n\nLooking at the last positions, the agent moved east in previous turns: (3,1) to (4,1) and so on. Going back to (3,1) would be backtracking, which I'd like to avoid if possible. My allowed moves are east, south, or west, but not north because of a wall. Moving east to (5,1) is fine since it\u2019s within the grid of width 30, and the space is free. Moving south to (4,2) is also free, while west to (3,1) would be immediate backtracking. So, I need to choose wisely!**Deciding on the next move**\n\nHeading east to (5,1) seems like a good option because there's no known obstacle in that patch\u2014it's free! Plus, my goal is to move east, which aligns with that direction. I also need to consider that I can only send one message per turn, so I probably shouldn\u2019t communicate for now. I'll check that there are no messages to respond to since the inbox seems empty. The best move would be to execute \"MOVE_E.\" \n\nFor the Decision, I'll format it as {action: {kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\"}}.**Preparing the decision structure**\n\nThe wrapper will encapsulate the action I need to take, and the expected \"Decision\" is a single structured object. The \"final_result\" will be sent to the system, following the OUTPUT CONTRACT, which outlines that I need to return a structured object conforming to the Decision model. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create an object with fields for action and comment: { \"action\": { \"kind\": \"MOVE\", \"direction\": \"E\" }, \"comment\": \"I moved east to make progress towards the east bearing and avoid backtracking, as the last step was also east.\" } This keeps the comment within the sentence limit and explains my decision logic!**Crafting the final action**\n\nAlright, I need to finalize my decision on the move. I'm opting for \"MOVE_E\" to progress towards the east, avoiding backtracking since my last step was also east. The direct path has no walls, and moving in this direction maximizes my progress and ensures safety. \n\nI need to structure my submission following the required format and call the `functions.final_result` tool in the commentary channel with my action and comment.

Since the north cell is a wall and both east and south are safe, moving east seems like the best option because it keeps me from backtracking and maximizes my progress.

It seems I moved south and then west. The most recent position is at (29,6). If I consider going back to (29,7), that would mean moving north. The initial step increased y from 6 to 7, confirming I went south. Now, if I were to move north from (29,6), it would require two steps back.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nI'm looking at my current position, which is (29,6). The last move was from (29,7) to (29,6) while moving north. According to my rule to avoid immediate backtracking, moving north to (29,5) wouldn't count as backtracking since (29,7) is the immediate previous position. So if I move south, I'll end up at (29,7), which is backtracking. Both north to (29,5) and south to (29,7) are free, but which one is the safer option?**Analyzing movement options toward a goal**\n\nI\u2019m looking at my recent path, which involved exploring but the goal is still unknown. The surrounding area has no obstacles. Right now, I\u2019m at (29,6) and if I check the cells north at (29,5) and south at (29,7), both positions are free. The north cell corresponds to row1 and has a free spot represented by '.', while the south cell at row3 also has a free spot. East is out of bounds and west is a wall, so I need to pick the best action to maximize my progress.**Deciding on movement strategy**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to proceed without clear goal information. Since I can't see any neighbors in view, I might want to explore within a 2-turn range to search for the goal. The agent is oriented south, thinking about moving either south or north. Communication isn\u2019t clear; we need minimal intent messages. I'll need to prepare a \"Decision\" object with specific fields like action. The allowed actions include moving in any direction (N/E/S/W), staying, or communicating. I need to inspect these options carefully!**Constructing the decision object**\n\nI need to address the \"MESSAGE\" that includes options like \"HELLO,\" \"HERE,\" and \"INTENT.\" Since I can't see a clear goal ahead, I should focus on maximizing progress. My immediate previous position was (29,7), so moving south would mean backtracking, which I want to avoid. Therefore, I'll choose to move north where I see a free cell. I'll format my \"Decision\" object to indicate I'm moving north while providing a short rationale for this choice. \n\nSo the final \"Decision\" object will look like this:\n\n{\n  \"action\": {\n    \"kind\": \"MOVE\",\n    \"direction\": \"N\"\n  },\n  \"comment\": \"I moved north to avoid backtracking into the previous position (south). The northern cell is free, while the only other open direction is south back toward the prior cell, so this keeps exploration progressing safely.\"\n} \n\nNow, I just need to deliver this through the tool as per instructions.**Preparing the tool call**\n\nI'm getting ready to make the function call to finalize my decision.

If I map from y=0 to y=4 and x from 3 to 7, then the A's local coordinates \u2014 a row index of 2 means it's at y=2, and a column index of 2 suggests x=5. So, it's at (5,2), while I'm at (5,1), meaning A is north of me. But there's also an agent at (5,2), and I need to clarify the S cell's position.**Understanding adjacency**\n\nI'm looking at the patch, where the top row y=0 shows \"#####,\" confirming that N is indeed a wall. The E neighbor at (6,1) is marked FREE, and S has (5,2) noted as FREE, but there's an A at that same position. It seems like S is classified as FREE, even though there's an AGENT present. Maybe I need to reconsider how I label A, since it might not be considered a neighbor in view? The A at (5,2) is directly south of me, which complicates things.**Clarifying adjacency and goals**\n\nThe adjacency indicates S is marked FREE, which seems contradictory since there's an A in the patch, but maybe A stands for artifact? Sometimes A means agent, and I\u2019m also an agent (a1). If there's an agent to the south, then S should be labeled AGENT, but it\u2019s showing FREE instead. Perhaps A in the patch is the goal, though that doesn't align with the rules I've got. I need to follow the adjacency list for safe moves. Currently, S, E, and W are FREE, while N is a WALL. It looks like I have a southeast goal bearing, possibly towards (6,2). I just need to confirm if that direction is within my view.**Choosing an action**\n\nI need to select one action that maximizes progress toward the goal while avoiding collisions. There seems to be another agent to the south at (5,2), but adjacency lists it as FREE, which is confusing. If I move south into (5,2), I would collide with this agent. The recent positions show a movement sequence from (5,1) to (1,1), moving left along the x-axis. So moving back to (5,1) from (4,1) would involve returning, but I\u2019d need to clarify the last move. The newest position is (5,1).**Deciding on movement**\n\nI need to decide on an action that maximizes team progress toward the goal while avoiding collisions. The last move was from (4,1) to (5,1) going east, so backtracking west to (4,1) might be allowed, but it's best to avoid that if I have safe options. East to (6,1) or south to (5,2) are both potential moves, but I need to avoid colliding with the agent at (5,2). Since S is marked FREE without an adjacent AGENT, moving East to (6,1) looks like the better choice. I\u2019ll decide to MOVE East and consider whether to communicate my action, but I might just keep it simple. I\u2019ll follow the decision model and prepare the appropriate structured object for output.**Defining decision structure**\n\nI'm working on defining my action according to the \"Decision\" model, which I think should be similar to the \"final_result\" structure. I need to generate a JSON object that includes the action to move East and a concise comment. My comment will explain that moving east keeps progressing toward the southeast goal while avoiding backtracking. I must call the functions.final_result tool to format this appropriately before sharing it. After that, I'll output the final decision to the user following the required structure.**Crafting action output**\n\nI'm ready to create my action output for moving east. The action will be structured as follows: it states that I'm choosing to move East to advance towards the southeast goal while avoiding backtracking and the potential collision with the south cell. Given that North is a wall, moving East seems to be the safest option. Now, I'll proceed with the tool call to execute this decision.

If I move north, that takes me to (29,4). Since north means y - 1, I see that the adjacent position is free. Moving to (29,4) isn\u2019t backtracking since going back to (29,6) involves moving south, which I want to avoid. So, I should choose to move north instead. The goal sensor indicates that north is the direction to my goal, so decision: MOVE_N. Communicating a minimal message could be optional.**Formulating the Decision object**\n\nI need to output one Decision object, specifically indicating the action: MOVE in the direction of N. The instructions clearly state that this should be a structured object following the Decision model. I have to ensure I know the schema. The final result type allows actions like MOVE, STAY, and COMMUNICATE. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object that looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"action\": { \"kind\": \"MOVE\", \"direction\": \"N\" },\n  \"comment\": \"...\"\n}\n\nI think I\u2019ve captured the necessary fields correctly!**Clarifying execution requirements**\n\nI see that the final_result function requires \"action\" and \"comment\" at the top level. It's important to consider the execution rules too\u2014if no safe move exists, I'd normally stay, but in this case, there is a safe move. I\u2019ll also need to think about the COMM_LIMITS and goal_sensor details, even if they're not strictly necessary right now. I definitely need to call a function tool before I can produce the final answer. I can't just output final_result without invoking this tool!**Planning function call and response**\n\nI should call functions.final_result with the action object and the comment, so the system can show the result to the user. Typically, I make the function call and then provide the final content in the next assistant message. The structure involves sending a tool call in the commentary channel, followed by an empty final response. I need to follow this pattern since the system requires the final answer to be a Decision object after receiving the tool's response.**Implementing function call process**\n\nAlright, I need to call functions.final_result with the action and comment structured correctly. The standard approach is to call the tool first, which will return a result, and then provide the final answer. It's crucial to ensure the output is a structured Decision object.\n\nSo, my tool call should look like this:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"N\" },\n  comment: \"Moving North keeps progress toward the North-bearing goal.

Moving West to (5,1) feels like backtracking, which is only allowed if it\u2019s safe. I see that East (to 7,1) leads to unknown territory, but it seems like it might head toward the goal. The goal likely lies to the East, so since it\u2019s free and looks clear of agents, moving East feels like the right choice. I could also send a message about the goal hint.**Considering communication options**\n\nI see the goal is bearing East, which is far away. Maybe it\u2019s a good idea to send a GOAL_HINT to indicate the goal\u2019s proximity. Communication is optional, and if I do, the instructions say to keep it minimal. The free space to the East could really benefit from that hint. I can send a MARK message with a GOAL_HINT in the placement object, which seems like a proper way to communicate the goal's location effectively.**Deciding on communication details**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the \"GOAL_HINT,\" which includes a ttl_remaining integer, and I\u2019m thinking about how it fits in the \"MARK\" object. The \"MARK\" will have a placement that can include the GOAL_HINT fields. Keeping a \"comment\" in the Decision object seems sensible to explain my reasoning in a couple of sentences. I need to weigh whether to communicate; I might send an INTENT to announce my next action since there\u2019s a risk of collision.**Planning communication and movement**\n\nI see there are no agents to the East or West, so I\u2019m considering my movement options. Since the max outbound per turn is 1, if I decide to move East, I should broadcast an \"INTENT\" with the \"next_action\" as \"MOVE_E.\" The sender_id would be \"a1,\" and I'll choose a sequence number of 0 since it's my first message on this turn. The goal is collision avoidance, but communication isn\u2019t necessary right now since no agents are visible. I\u2019ll call one of the defined function tools beforehand.**Preparing action for final result**\n\nI\u2019m gearing up to call functions.final_result with my movement decision. I need to prepare an action object and ensure it follows the Decision model. Since moving East seems to be the best option, I\u2019ll specify the action as { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" }.

The required structure only allows for one action, and I think including a comment about why this direction is optimal would be helpful.

To do this, the instructions say I must call a tool function before finalizing my response. So, I'll call functions.final_result with a movement decision, which could be MOVE N/E/S/W, STAY, or COMMUNICATE. To help, I\u2019ll check the OBSERVATION_JSON: my self-reference is agent_id a1 at absolute position x7 y1, facing North. Analyzing the local patch, I notice there are walls to the North and South but free spaces to the East and West.**Analyzing movement and positions**\n\nI see that the north and south cells are walls, while the east cell is free and the west cell is also free. The agent's recent positions start from (7,1) down to (3,1), indicating that it moved east from (6,1) to (7,1). Since backtracking to (6,1) would be prohibited unless it's the only safe option, I should avoid that move. It appears I can choose to move to the east or west since there's no immediate backtracking in that direction.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nLooking at the cell to the west, which is (6,1), I notice that's in the second-to-last recent position. So, it\u2019s best to avoid backtracking there if possible. The east cell, (8,1), is free, so I could move there. I want to check for obstacles, and from my observations, the local patch shows that the entire area around it is filled with walls, apart from where the agent is located on row y=2. There do seem to be walls at y=3, but the east cell remains open.**Assessing obstacles and positions**\n\nIt looks like there are some obstacles in the patch, which complicates things. But since the adjacent info clearly states there are walls to the north and south, moving east and west is still an option. The agent's position is at (7,1), but there seems to be confusion with the patch showing \"A\" at (7,2). I need to align the patch coordinates and ensure I'm working with consistent positions. Despite the obstacles mentioned, I can still move east or west since those spaces are free.**Finalizing the movement decision**\n\nI've determined that moving east to (8,1) is safe since it's free, while west (6,1) would mean backtracking, which I want to avoid. There's no risk of colliding with other agents, and there's a goal bearing to the east. So, I plan to create a Decision object specifying an action to MOVE_E. This object will also include a comment explaining the reasoning: that east is free, backtracking is avoided, and the goal is aligned in that direction. I\u2019ll ensure the tool call conforms to the expected structure with action and comment fields, and then follow up with the final Decision output after receiving the response.**Executing the tool call for movement**\n\nMy plan is clear: I'll call the tool with a defined action to move east, specifying that the east cell is free and indicates no backtracking. The goal is aligned in that direction. I\u2019ll structure my comment to be concise but informative, ensuring it consists of 1-3 sentences: I want to say something like, \u201cChoosing MOVE_E because moving east is safe and furthers my goal.\u201d After the tool response, I\u2019ll present the final Decision object without any extra text.

It seems that an agent could be nearby, and adjacent FREE spaces might mean they aren't occupied. I should consider the \"goal_sensor\" bearing NW, which indicates that the goal is close but not necessarily reachable this turn. Moving West might help me get closer to NW. If my current position is (29,3) and I move to (28,3), the new goal bearing would need to be re-evaluated. We must ensure any move is safe and adheres to the expected \"Decision\" format.**Deciding on the next move**\n\nI see there\u2019s an optional \"INTENT\" message, possibly signaling \"BLOCKED,\" but I'm going to focus on movement. We can only move, not communicate right now, so I need to decide whether to go West or North to get closer to NW. To assess safety, I should look at the local patch, which appears to be a 5x4 grid with obstacles like \"#\" and \"G.\" The top-left position is (27,1), and I should consider the coordinates carefully since our agent's position is (29,3). It's essential to assume the rows increase downward.**Mapping the grid**\n\nLet's set up the grid based on the top-left coordinates at (27,1). The patch includes coordinates from (27..31) for x and (1..5) for y. I can break down each row: Row 0 shows obstacles and a \"G\" at (28,1). The agent is at (29,3), so we\u2019re clear that the area around has walls marked with '#'. \n\nN (29,2) is free, and West (28,3) is also clear. My best move is to go North and then West toward the goal at (28,1).**Finding the path to the goal**\n\nFrom my current position at (29,3), the goal is located at (28,1), with a bearing of NW that suggests an offset of (-1,-2). To navigate efficiently, I could move North to (29,2), then check the next position (29,1), which is clear. So, I could then move West to reach the goal at (28,1). This path means moving North twice would bring me closer to the goal. I'll need to make sure to move one step at a time!**Making the decision**\n\nI\u2019ll choose to \"MOVE_N\" to (29,2). Moving North is not backtracking since my previous position was (29,4). There\u2019s no visible collision with other agents either, so I\u2019ll go ahead with the action: {\"kind\":\"MOVE\",\"direction\":\"N\"}. I need to prepare a comment explaining my reasoning.

The North and South have walls while the East and West are free. There's a \"goal_sensor\" pointing East, indicating that's where the goal lies. I need to look at the last five positions: (8,1) to (4,1), with my current position at (8,1). The movements show a decrease in x values as I move west. Turning East now would mean backtracking.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nThe rule says to avoid immediate backtracking unless it's the only safe choice. Looking at my last five positions: from (8,1) to (4,1), moving West would lead me to (7,1), which is indeed in my recent positions. The last move was to (4,1). Now, moving East back to (5,1) counts as backtracking, but it's allowed if necessary. I see that East and West are both free, with a goal to the East, so I should consider that direction.**Deciding on movement direction**\n\nMoving East seems like the best way to progress toward the goal, especially since the \"goal_sensor\" indicates it's far away in that direction. There's nothing blocking the path to the East, and while there's an 'A' at the center and an 'E' nearby, there\u2019s no GOAL cell adjacent. Based on my last five positions, moving to (9,1) isn\u2019t backtracking, so it looks safe. Plus, the surrounding area is clear.

I need to avoid backtracking unless absolutely necessary, which means I should move east instead of going back.**Deciding on movement**\n\nI'm considering moving east because the goal sensor indicates a bearing of \"E\" and it seems there might be a goal in that direction, possibly at (10,1).

The function will determine whether to MOVE in one of the four directions or to STAY. Considering my current position at x29,y1 and the adjacent cells\u2014there's a wall to the north, out of bounds to the east, a free cell to the south, and the goal to the west. So, moving west (\"MOVE_W\") towards the goal seems like the right choice!**Analyzing goal sensor and grid**\n\nI see there's a \"goal_sensor\" to the northwest, with its strength marked as NEAR, indicating the goal is in that direction. However, the adjacent GOAL to the west suggests there's already a goal there. The NW bearing might refer to a goal in another cell. I'm looking at a local patch with a radius of 2 from absolute coordinates (27,0). The grid shows rows that help confirm positions\u2014especially the \".GA##\" sequence indicating a goal. I need to map those coordinates carefully!**Clarifying goal and agent positions**\n\nIn the patch, I see 'G' at index 1 and 'A' at index 2\u2014those correspond to positions (28,2) for 'G' and (29,2) for 'A'. The 'A' represents the agent, but my self_pos is actually (29,1), which is a little confusing because the patch shows the agent in a different position. There might be a mix-up with indexing. The relevant neighbors in view are mostly walls or out of bounds, but there's a GOAL to the west, so moving there could be a viable option!**Planning the next movement**\n\nI want to move forward, but there's a risk with my communication options. The guideline suggests keeping messages minimal; technically, I don't have to communicate\u2014I can just make my move. I need to watch out for backtracking using my recent positions: the last five are [(29,1), (29,2), (29,3), (29,4), (29,5)], with my current position being (29,1). If I consider moving south to (29,2), that's actually backtracking, which is not allowed unless it's my only safe option. So, I need to think carefully about my next step!**Finalizing the movement decision**\n\nI\u2019m ready to move west towards the goal, but first, I need to make sure I'm not backtracking, since moving south would return me to (29,2), which is disallowed. The adjacent cell to the north is a wall, and east is out of bounds. The only safe and productive move is to the west into the goal cell.

North is a wall, east is out of bounds, and moving south would backtrack to a recently visited position.\" } Then, I\u2019ll call the function to submit this decision!**Preparing the action call**\n\nI need to define my action in the structure required: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"W\" }. According to the Decision model, \"action\" must conform to allowed variants. I'll call the final_result function with the structured object. My parameters will include the action to move west and a comment explaining why that\u2019s the best choice. I\u2019ll ensure the comment is a single paragraph with two sentences.

If the top-left y equals 0, then for row 2, y is 2, so the agent could be at (10,2). However, there's a mismatch because the absolute position says (10,1). The data shows no neighboring artifacts available, but the goal sensor indicates a goal far to the east. Therefore, I should consider movement options east or west while keeping in mind the previous path taken.**Determining agent movement**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the local patch with the top-left at (8,0) where the rows go from 0 to 4. The agent is at y=1, which should match row 1, but it seems like A is in row 2. I need to decide on a safe move since only east and west are free. However, I don\u2019t know if there are goals in those directions. \"FREE\" indicates there are no walls or agents nearby, but I want to avoid backtracking based on recent positions.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nIf I move east to (11,1), that feels like a forward direction compared to my previous moves to the west. Checking my recent positions, they show a pattern of moving west from (10,1) down to (6,1). I want to avoid backtracking, so heading east again makes sense because my last move was actually from (9,1) to (10,1), which was toward the east. Since (11,1) isn\u2019t in my recent positions and is marked as free, that sounds like a good plan!**Deciding on movement direction**\n\nI think moving east sounds like a reasonable choice, as it\u2019s moving forward from my last direction. Plus, the goal is bearing east, and heading that way could help me get closer to it. The maximum communication range of 2 means I can check my surroundings, but I need to make a decision about moving east or possibly staying to avoid a collision. Given that both east and west are free, the simplest action seems like MOVE_E. I\u2019ll also include a brief comment to explain this reasoning.**Planning tool usage**\n\nI need to call a function tool in my response as directed by the developer instruction. The relevant tool seems to be the \"final_result\" tool, which expects a decision object. I\u2019ll create the action, likely \"MOVE_E,\" and include a comment about my reasoning. This means I'll prepare a structured object with both action and comment, like:\n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"E\"\n  },\n  comment: \"Reasoning text...\"\n}\n\nThen, I\u2019ll call the tool and wait for the response, which will lead to the final output.**Preparing tool call**\n\nI need to craft the initial tool call for the \"final_result\" function with the decision object. That means I'll specify the action to move east and provide a comment detailing my reasoning. The comment should be concise but informative, ideally fitting within one paragraph, like: \"Move East to advance toward the goal bearing east while avoiding backtracking; the north and south cells are walls, and recent positions show westward movement.\" \n\nNext, I\u2019ll call the function and wait for the tool's response to proceed.", "id": "reasoning", "signature": null, "provider_name": "openrouter", "part_kind": "thinking"}, {"tool_name": "final_result", "args": "{\"action\":{\"kind\":\"MOVE\",\"direction\":\"E\"},\"comment\":\"Move East to advance toward the east-bearing goal while avoiding backtracking; the north and south adjacent cells are walls, and the recent_positions show a westward path, so continuing east is the safest forward progress.\"}", "tool_call_id": "call_0XB2YcvsSBzJQ7vXZkJJL8q3", "id": null, "part_kind": "tool-call"}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2085, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 3272, "input_audio_tokens": 0, "cache_audio_read_tokens": 0, "output_audio_tokens": 0, "details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3200}}, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5-nano", "timestamp": "2025-10-30T13:42:30Z", "kind": "response", "provider_name": "openrouter", "provider_details": {"finish_reason": "tool_calls"}, "provider_response_id": "gen-1761831750-W7F4PSV0Q8tCFNX9l342", "finish_reason": "tool_call"}, {"parts": [{"tool_name": "final_result", "content": "Final result processed.", "tool_call_id": "call_0XB2YcvsSBzJQ7vXZkJJL8q3", "metadata": null, "timestamp": "2025-10-30T13:43:04.184252Z", "part_kind": "tool-return"}], "instructions": null, "kind": "request"}]}

This might be due to differences in the coordinate system, but I\u2019ll trust the absolute position of (11,1). However, the patch shows A at (11,2). It seems rows indexing could be at play here. I\u2019ll consider adjacent data: N WALL, E WALL, S FREE, W FREE. The potential moves are limited due to walls, so I\u2019ll need to choose a safe move south or west.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nMoving from (11,1) to (10,1) is west; I realize backtracking would mean returning east. However, \"MOVE_E\" identifies east as an option, but there\u2019s a wall there. In considering my movement, if I go west to (10,1), I'm backtracking since it\u2019s in the \"recent_positions.\" The rule advises against immediate backtracking unless it's the only safe choice. I'd have the options of moving south to (11,2) or west to (10,1). I'll weigh those choices against the walls and grid layout.**Analyzing movement options**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the local patch and see that row2 col2 is A. Checking the cells around it: south relative to the agent is row3, which shows that position (row3 col2) is free, indicated by a \".\". The position west of A, (row2 col1), is also free. Since both south and west are safe options, I\u2019ll avoid backtracking and go south (MOVE_S) to potentially get closer to the goal, which is bearing east. Moving south could help align me better for that!**Structuring the decision**\n\nI need to create a \"Decision\" object with specific fields. The action will be \"MOVE\" in the direction south ('S'). The structure should look like this:  \n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"S\"\n  },\n  comment: \"...\"\n}\n\nBut I should ensure it conforms to the \"Decision\" model. The guidelines state I must return a single structured object that meets the `Decision` model requirements. I\u2019ll make sure that any additional fields required, like comment, are included appropriately!**Creating the Decision object**\n\nI need to output a \"Decision\" object with specific fields. The action will be a move south (denoted as 'S'). The structure I\u2019ll produce is like this:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"S\" },\n  comment: \"South is the safest available move since north and east are blocked by walls; west would backtrack to a recently visited cell, which wouldn't help progress.\"\n}\n\nNow I need to call the functions.final_result with this JSON object to output the Decision object correctly! It's crucial to follow the guidance here, so I'll proceed with that!**Implementing the Decision object**\n\nI\u2019m gearing up to produce the final content, which should be the Decision object. The standard flow here is to call the tool, receive its output, and then present that in the final message. I\u2019ll need to ensure I\u2019m only including the Decision content without any extra commentary.\n\nSo, my parameters are set to:  \n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"S\"\n  },\n  comment: \"South is the safest available option since north and east are walls; moving west would backtrack to a recent cell, while south continues progress toward the goal.\"\n}\n\nLet\u2019s make that tool call now!", "id": "reasoning", "signature": null, "provider_name": "openrouter", "part_kind": "thinking"}, {"tool_name": "final_result", "args": "{\"action\":{\"kind\":\"MOVE\",\"direction\":\"S\"},\"comment\":\"South is the safest available option since north and east are walls and moving west would backtrack to a recently visited cell; moving south keeps us progressing toward the goal while staying within the local patch.\"}", "tool_call_id": "call_8xoF9GrffelK2MtPeiVdStNy", "id": null, "part_kind": "tool-call"}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2085, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 2629, "input_audio_tokens": 0, "cache_audio_read_tokens": 0, "output_audio_tokens": 0, "details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2560}}, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5-nano", "timestamp": "2025-10-30T13:43:04Z", "kind": "response", "provider_name": "openrouter", "provider_details": {"finish_reason": "tool_calls"}, "provider_response_id": "gen-1761831784-3WNNSVRiIZHQ1CnGYemC", "finish_reason": "tool_call"}, {"parts": [{"tool_name": "final_result", "content": "Final result processed.", "tool_call_id": "call_8xoF9GrffelK2MtPeiVdStNy", "metadata": null, "timestamp": "2025-10-30T13:43:30.897047Z", "part_kind": "tool-return"}], "instructions": null, "kind": "request"}]}

I think I should create a decision with just one action for clarity. Based on the tool\u2019s output, it looks like we'll get a \"final_result,\" which I should return. The platform expects a structured object, so I'll focus on deriving the best action based on my observations of the grid and position. Wait, the patch size seems larger than I thought!**Interpreting agent's movements**\n\nI see that with a radius of 2, the patch covers a 5x5 grid around the agent, with the top-left at (9,0). It seems there are no neighbors or artifacts in view, so I need to focus on the adjacent tiles: N is FREE, E is a WALL, S is FREE, and W is also a WALL. Since the goal is to the East and strength is FAR, I need to avoid backtracking to (11,1) from (11,2). My choices are to move NORTH or SOUTH.**Clarifying movement rules**\n\nThe agent is currently at (11,2), and moving North takes me to (11,1), which is the last position. Since backtracking is not allowed, going North would retrace my step. The recent positions confirm that (11,2) is the current position and (11,1) is the previous one. So, moving North from (11,2) to (11,1) is technically backtracking, which I need to avoid. But now I'm wondering: is there any exception to this rule regarding where I can move?**Evaluating next move**\n\nThe rule states I should avoid immediate backtracking unless it's the only safe option. Here, moving North would be backtracking, while moving South is safe. Since East and West are blocked by walls, the best move is to go South. Although the goal is to the East, moving South might help explore around the wall. I need to balance the goal\u2019s direction with available paths, and the sensor confirms the goal is still to the East, but the wall complicates progress.**Crafting the decision object**\n\nI see that moving East is blocked by walls, but bearing East suggests there might be a route I can explore later. Given that moving North would backtrack, South is the only safe option. I need to summarize my reasoning concisely, stating that I can't return to (11,1) and that the walls prevent East or West movement. So, I should call the function with a structured Decision object that instructs to MOVE South, adding my reasoning in the comment as a concise paragraph. After calling the tool, I\u2019ll follow up with the required structured object as the final content.**Navigating tool call processes**\n\nHistorically, I understand that the assistant typically outputs final content after the tool results without showing those results directly to the user. However, in this situation, I need to call the tool and then provide the Decision object in a single turn. I\u2019ll aim to call the function with the required action to move South and include a comment for clarity. After receiving the tool's response, I plan to present the same Decision object as the final output, since that's what's required.

The goal is East, and any chosen move should minimize collisions. Since moving back to (11,2) would be backtracking, it seems best to avoid that. The available options are moving East, South, or West. Given that the goal is East, it makes sense to move that way as it allows the highest progress. Additionally, I should consider sending an INTENT message to keep others informed about our next step.**Deciding on movement**\n\nThe \"inbox\" is empty, and I see the \"goal_sensor\" is ready. I can choose not to communicate, which helps keep noise low. However, according to instructions, if I do communicate, it should be minimal. I\u2019ll create a Decision object with the action set to MOVE and the direction as \"E.\" My comment will explain that moving East helps progress toward the goal while avoiding backtracking to previous cells. It's important to match the Decision object with the expected schema for functions.final_result.**Formulating the final result**\n\nThe \"final_result\" tool requires an \"action\" field, so I'll provide the following structure: \n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"E\"\n  },\n  comment: \"Moving East aligns with the goal and avoids backtracking to (11,2). While S and W options are valid, they don't efficiently advance toward the goal.\"\n\nI need to call functions.final_result first, as instructed by the developer. Once I implement that, the system is expected to respond. I\u2019ll craft this comment to summarize the reasoning. Then, it's time to perform the function call!**Verifying movement legality**\n\nI need to ensure the patch constraints for moving East to (12,3) are satisfied. Yes, it looks good! The local patch shows that (12,3) is empty, and the \"neighbors_in_view\" is clear. The adjacent check confirms that moving East is free and there's no agent there. So, I'm ready to call functions.final_result with the action to MOVE East. \n\nOnce I call the tool, I\u2019ll capture the returned data and present it in the \u201cfinal\u201d channel, following the guidelines provided.**Implementing decision structure**\n\nI need to use functions.final_result to generate the decision object, which will have the action set to MOVE East.

It looks like I need to avoid backtracking based on recent positions. Currently, my last move was from (12,3) to (11,3), which was West. So now I need to make sure that if I backtrack, I\u2019d need to go East back to (12,3). The recent positions show I have to be thoughtful about my choices.**Thinking through direction choices**\n\nIf I decide to move East, I'll go back to (13,3), which would count as backtracking. The rules suggest I should avoid that unless it's the only safe option. However, since going East back to (13,3) isn\u2019t really progressing, moving West to (11,3) feels like a better option. This move continues my direction rather than backtracking. I also need to check if there's an available cell at (10,3), but it appears to be free. So, moving West seems okay!**Clarifying backtracking rules**\n\nBacktracking means going back to the cell I just came from, which would be (13,3). To clarify, I started at (12,3) and moved to (11,3). So if I move East, I\u2019d return to (13,3), which counts as backtracking. Moving West would take me to (11,3), but that\u2019s where I just was too. The recent path is: starting at (12,3), moving West to (11,3), then down to (11,2), down again to (11,1), and West to (10,1). Ah, I see\u2014this clarifies my recent moves!**Examining position inconsistencies**\n\nCurrently, I'm at (12,3), which I reached by moving East from (13,3). However, the recent_positions list shows (12,3) first and (11,3) second, which is a bit confusing. If I'm at (12,3), my previous position would be (13,3), but (11,3) is listed as the second element. I think I moved East to get to (12,3) from (11,3) instead. It seems like there's an inconsistency here, but I\u2019ll rely on the recent_positions list as the final authority.**Determining the next action**\n\nI\u2019ve mapped out the paths, and right now I'm at (12,3). The last move was East from (11,3) to (12,3). If I go West, I'll backtrack to (11,3), which is not an option I want. Moving East to (13,3) is open, and aligns with my goal in that direction. I need to remember walls block North and South, and I should make sure to choose the East move since it supports my objective and keeps me progressing! \n\nSo, I'll create a Decision object for the next action! I\u2019ll structure it to say:  \n{\n action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" },\n comment: \"Move East to progress toward the goal; N and S are walls, and West would backtrack into the cell just visited (11,3). The east cell is free and aligns with the goal bearing.\"  \n}  \nThat's the plan! Now to execute this!**Planning the tool call and final output**\n\nI realize I need to make two separate messages: one for the tool call in the commentary, and another for the actual content in the final output. The content I present should match what's returned by the tool. \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll call functions.final_result to execute the move with this structure:  \n{\n action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" },\n comment: \"Move East to progress toward the goal; N and S are walls, and West would backtrack into the cell just visited (11,3). The east cell is free and aligns with the goal bearing.\"\n}  \n\nAfter the tool responds, I\u2019ll ensure the output in the final message mirrors this structure without any extra text.

I see there are possible moves North to (13,4), East to (14,3), South to (13,2), and West to (12,3). However, I must avoid backtracking to (12,3) since it\u2019s my last position unless it's the only safe option. Since adjacent states are all free, I'll favor moving to either North (13,4), East (14,3), or South (13,2).**Interpreting goal direction**\n\nI'm taking a look at the goal sensor, which indicates a bearing of \"E\" with a strength labeled as \"FAR.\" This suggests the goal is indeed to the East relative to my position. The goal bearing is \"E,\u201d and my local patch radius is set to 2, starting from the top left at (11,1).  \n\nI see the agent \"A\" is located on Row 2, Column 2 of the patch, which matches its absolute position of (13,3). This alignment is promising, as it means I should plan to maximize our progress toward the goal.**Choosing movement direction**\n\nThe goal is to the East, so I need to choose a movement that aligns with that bearing to get closer. Moving East to (14,3) increases my x-coordinate, which seems like a good plan. The adjacent cells are all marked as FREE, and since I don't see any neighbors in view, I think it\u2019s safe to proceed. There\u2019s no obstacle to my movement.  \n\nIf I move East, I should be reducing the distance to the goal, and since the grid width is 30 and height is 10, this seems like a promising maneuver!**Deciding on movement**\n\nMy goal is to the East, and since I'm currently positioned at (13,3), moving East seems like the best option. If I were to move North to (13,4), that shifts my y-coordinate, which isn't directly aligned with my goal bearing of East. I also need to ensure my movement won\u2019t cause a collision with any agents, and it looks safe to proceed East.  \n\nSo, my action will be to MOVE East, formatted as { action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" } }.

I\u2019m currently at (14,3), moving from (13,3) to the West. Normally, backtracking to (13,3) is possible, but rule 4 advises against immediate backtracking unless it\u2019s the only safe option. So, I think moving East to (15,3) is safer since the adjacent E is free. There\u2019s a goal bearing SE in the distance, which means this move could bring me closer.**Formulating a decision**\n\nThe goal is bearing SE, but it's far away, and my inbox is empty with no artifacts in view, so there\u2019s no need for communication. Since I can only send one outbound action per turn, we should avoid unnecessary messages. I'll create a Decision object as required, choosing to MOVE in the \"E\" direction. It\u2019s important to add a comment to explain my reasoning, and I need to ensure the Decision model matches the expected structure.**Structuring the action object**\n\nI\u2019m working on the action object for my Decision model. I\u2019ll define it as follows:\n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"E\"\n  },\n  comment: \"...\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the outer object needs to match the exact structure of {action: ..., comment: ...}. The output contract specifies that! So, I\u2019ll ensure I format it correctly. I need to use the functions.final_result tool to submit this structured response. It appears I can pass the complete Decision object structure to it for processing. Let\u2019s move forward and make that call!**Finalizing the action object**\n\nI\u2019m getting ready to produce the Decision object that looks like this:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" },\n  comment: \"Reasoning...\"\n}\n\nBut I need to ensure I pass the entire object as per the tool's argument requirements. The syntax looks correct, so I can go ahead and use:\n\n{\n  action: {\n    kind: \"MOVE\",\n    direction: \"E\"\n  },\n  comment: \"...\"\n}\n\nI\u2019ll avoid moving West to prevent backtracking and check for potential collisions. Since East is clear and might bring me closer to the SE goal, I\u2019ll finalize the decision to move East.**Preparing the final comment**\n\nI need to refine my comment about the move. I\u2019ll say something like this: \"East is the only non-wall option that doesn't backtrack into the previous position. There are no agents or immediate obstacles on that side, so this move advances toward the goal bearing without increasing collision risk.\"\n\nNow, I\u2019ll call the functions.final_result tool with the decision object. The structure will be:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" },\n  comment: \"East is the only non-wall option that doesn't backtrack into the previous position. There are no agents or immediate obstacles on that side, so this move advances toward the goal bearing without increasing collision risk.\"\n}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure everything is in order before making this call!**Understanding the tool call process**\n\nOkay, so the function returns \"any,\" and I'm hoping the next message will display the final Decision. It looks like we can\u2019t send two messages in one turn, since the tool call is separate from the final response. The final content should be the Decision object, following the output contract I need to adhere to.\n\nI plan to call the functions.final_result tool with the Decision object now.

However, if I move north or south, I might find a way around those walls later. Looking at the patch grid around the agent position, the cell to the north is free. Analyzing the patch coordinates, I see walls at (14,2), (15,2), and (16,2), while (13,2) and (17,2) are free. But right now, I should focus on the north cell, which corresponds to (15,3).**Deciding on movement direction**\n\nI see that moving east is blocked by walls, so I\u2019m considering my options. The north position (15,3) is free, but going there means backtracking, which I want to avoid. Moving south to (15,5) looks better since it\u2019s also free, allowing me to eventually progress east along row 5 where (16,5) is open. The best move right now seems to be south, which aligns with the goal of heading east in the future. I also note that communicating intent isn\u2019t necessary for this turn. So, I\u2019ll choose to move south.**Preparing the decision output**\n\nI'm working on the action to move south. The structure for my decision must include both the action and a comment explaining my reasoning. I realize the comment should be concise and one paragraph, around 1-3 sentences. So, I'll state: \"Chosen move S to step around the east wall since E is blocked and N would backtrack. Moving south opens a path along row y=5 toward the goal bearing east.\" Next, I\u2019ll call the necessary function tool with this decision.**Executing the action call**\n\nI'm about to call the function to execute my decision. I'll be passing the action to move south and my reasoning in the comment. The comment I\u2019ve crafted is: \"I moved south to progress around the barrier since east is blocked and north would backtrack to the previous position.

The current positions for E and W show they both occupy free cells. Moving E to (17,5) or W to (15,5) seems possible since there are no agents in those cells, and I checked \"neighbors_in_view\" which is empty.\n\nThe goal is to the east, described as far away, so moving East would likely reduce the distance. Also, reviewing recent positions shows moving East to (17,5) is not backtracking. Therefore, I should choose to MOVE_E.**Deciding on movement**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any safe moves, but the possibility of collision doesn't seem to be an issue here. I can communicate with minimal messaging, which is optional. Since the cell East is free, moving that way makes sense.\n\nI'll create the Decision object with the action to move East.

North and South are walls, and moving West would mean backtracking into a recently visited cell, which is disallowed unless it's the only option. Since East decreases the distance to the goal and there are no other actors in view, I can confidently say that moving East is the best choice.

The tool expects both the \"action\" and \"comment\" fields in the Decision object, and it will return a response. The pattern here is to first call the tool with my final decision, then the system will give me back a result. After that, I think I need to generate a final message for the user. This call is essential, as the output contract specifies that my final message should include the Decision object while calling the function in the same step.**Preparing the tool call**\n\nI need to structure my decision payload for the tool call correctly.

The developer's instructions specify that I must call a function tool before yielding any response. Even if it feels unnecessary, I have to select the most relevant tool from the functions namespace and describe the action in my final result. Typically, I'd call the function and then present the Decision object, but since the tool returns in a commentary channel, I will organize the output effectively after parsing the observation.**Mapping agent's surroundings**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a local patch where the top left is at coordinates (15,3). The top row corresponds to y=3, and my agent is currently at (17,5) facing North. I\u2019ve identified the adjacent directions: North, East, and West are all free, while South is blocked by a wall. The agent is represented in the grid, specifically in row 2. Given the information, the agent\u2019s position is indexed, noting the grid\u2019s layout, which helps clarify possible movements and surrounding statuses.**Analyzing recent positions**\n\nI\u2019ve got the last five positions which show that the current location is indeed (17,5). The previous positions indicate a sequence of moves, with the latest being (17,5) first in the list. I should avoid backtracking to (16,5) or (15,5) unless there\u2019s no safe option. The immediate backtrack to (16,5) by moving West isn\u2019t allowed because we want to take the East route, which is free. The goal bearing indicates there\u2019s a target to the East, so moving there is optimal!**Checking goal and positions**\n\nIn the patch, I see that \"A\" is at an unspecified location, but there\u2019s no visible goal in the adjacent statuses. The neighboring positions to the North, East, and West are free, while the South is a wall. The goal could be far beyond view, but since the neighbors in view show no other agents, it seems safe to move East to (18,5). Checking the grid bounds reveals that (18,5) is within the patch, and Row 2 confirms there are no obstacles in that area.**Crafting the decision object**\n\nI\u2019m working on the decision to move East to the cell (18,5), which is free and aligns with the goal bearing. To avoid backtracking, I\u2019ll ensure my reasoning supports this decision: advancing East not only avoids revisiting (16,5) but also helps progress toward the goal. I\u2019ll structure the Decision object with an action indicating the MOVE in the East direction and add a comment explaining my reasoning clearly in two sentences. Then I\u2019ll call the function tool to finalize.**Preparing to send final object**\n\nI\u2019m ready to send the final decision object in the \"final\" channel. I\u2019ll call the function with the pre-composed JSON, which indicates I\u2019m moving East.

In row 0 (y=3), I have the pattern \"#...#\" at x=16 to 20, followed by row 1 (y=4) as \"#.#.#\", and row 2 (y=5) showing \"..A.#\". Notably, there\u2019s an 'A' in row 2 at (19,5), which might indicate another agent's presence. The adjacent list shows that north is a wall, so it seems there\u2019s no agent there.**Interpreting agent positions**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a patch where there's an 'A' at (19,5) indicating another agent nearby, but my own agent at (18,5) isn't marked since it\u2019s the local patch around me. My orientation indicates neighbors in view are empty, and the inbox is clear. In terms of movement, I see walls to the north and south, while east and west are free. The goal sensor indicates that the goal is to the east. I'll need to avoid backtracking to (17,5) if it's unsafe.**Considering movement options**\n\nMoving west takes me to (17,5), the previous position I just came from. Based on my current position at (18,5), the neighbors show west as (17,5) and east as (19,5). Backtracking would mean going back to (17,5), which I want to avoid. My last position list indicates that my movement was from (17,5) to (18,5) towards the east. Since I can only go east or west, and moving east aligns with the goal direction, I prefer to head east to (19,5).**Assessing movement safety**\n\nIt's important to avoid collision risks as I check my adjacent positions. The adjacent list indicates that east is free, so there's no agent there, even though there's an 'A' at (19,5) which might represent another agent or something else like an artifact. Since the artifacts_in_view is empty, there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles. Moving east aligns with my goal direction and seems like a safe option. Although I could choose to stay, I think moving east is the best choice. So, the action is to move east.**Preparing decision output**\n\nI need to create a Decision object formatted correctly for the system. The action I\u2019m choosing is to move east, which means I\u2019ll set the action kind to \"MOVE\" and the direction to \"E.\" For the comment, I want it to be a clear paragraph of 1-3 sentences explaining the reasoning, making sure to avoid backtracking. Therefore, my final object will specify that moving east aligns with the goal direction, which is open. I'll call the functions.final_result tool with this Decision before yielding the final content.**Executing tool call for decision**\n\nThe system expects a \"Decision\" object as the final output, but I need to call the tool first. I understand the usual pattern is to send the tool call, wait for the response, and then present the final decision. I\u2019ll call the functions.final_result tool with my decision to move east, and I\u2019ll include a comment about why this choice aligns with the goal and avoids backtracking.

Currently, I\u2019m at (19,5), and the adjacent statuses show that North (19,4) and West (18,5) are free, but both East (20,5) and South (19,6) are walls. So, I can only move North or West. Since I'm at (19,5) now, I shouldn't backtrack to (18,5), which I just came from. I've noted my last five positions to avoid immediate backtracking.**Assessing backtracking rules**\n\nMy current position is (19,5), and the last five positions include the current one. The immediate option to move back would be to (18,5), which is second in my recent list. I could move North to (19,4) or West to (18,5). However, moving West is technically backtracking since I just came from (18,5) to (19,5), which is an eastward move. So, going back to (18,5) would feel like a reverse of my last direction.**Choosing safe moves**\n\nGoing back to (18,5) would be considered backtracking, which isn\u2019t ideal, but I could do it if there\u2019s no other safe option. Now, if I move North to (19,4), I need to check what's there. The position at (19,4) is open and clear. South to (19,6) is blocked by a wall, so my choices are to go North or West, or I could simply stay still. I should aim for a safe move that gets me closer to my goal in the northeast direction.**Deciding on movement direction**\n\nThe goal direction is northeast, so moving North would help since East is blocked by a wall. There's also a free space to the West, but going back to (18,5) would be backtracking, which I want to avoid. The immediate previous position is indeed (18,5), so North is my best choice. Communication isn't necessary for this move, but I\u2019ll still log a Decision object with the action to MOVE North and consider including an INTENT for better collision avoidance.**Finalizing decision and action**\n\nI need to decide on my next move. If I choose to move now, I should send an INTENT to indicate \"MOVE_N\" for collision avoidance, although it\u2019s optional. The action should be structured as a Decision model with the kind \"MOVE\" and the direction \"N.\" \n\nMy comment will explain my reasoning in one or two sentences.

I need to prepare to call the tool with the required fields. The action should be structured as: \n\naction: {\n  kind: \"MOVE\",\n  direction: \"N\"\n}\n\nThen, I'll add the comment explaining my reasoning clearly.

Moving north would mean decreasing the y-coordinate, going to (19,3), while south would take me back to (19,5), which is backtracking. Since I want to avoid that, I\u2019ll go with north if it\u2019s safe. The adjacent list indicates that north is free, but there's a '#' in the top-left patch. So, let's evaluate that further!**Mapping agent's position**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the patch around the agent based on the 5x5 grid. The agent 'A' is located at (19,4), and I\u2019m looking closely at the rows of the grid. The first row reveals a wall indicated by '#'. Each subsequent row helps clarify where the agent sits amid these structures. So for the cell directly north of the agent, it\u2019s at (19,3). I just need to keep double-checking these coordinates to ensure accuracy in my mapping!**Evaluating movement options**\n\nI\u2019m mapping the agent\u2019s location at (19,4), which corresponds to row index 2. The north cell at (19,3) is free, as indicated by the '.' in the row string. Meanwhile, the east cell (20,4) is a wall, and the south cell (19,5) is also free but leads back to the last position\u2014so that's technically backtracking. The west cell has a wall as well. So, if it's safe, I should definitely choose to move north!**Deciding on next move**\n\nI'm focusing on the goal bearing, which is east and far away. However, that direction is blocked by a wall, so it's not an option for movement. My inbox is empty, and there are no neighbors or artifacts in view, so the best action is to move north. There\u2019s no risk of collision in the north cell since no other agents are there, making it safe. I need to prepare a Decision object according to the required structure for the action.**Preparing decision output**\n\nI\u2019m structuring the decision for my next action. The action is to \"MOVE\" north since that cell is free and not blocked. I also need to provide a comment explaining this choice. So, I\u2019ll say something like: \"Move North because the northern cell is free and unoccupied, allowing forward progress. South would backtrack to the previous position, while East and West are blocked by walls.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare to call the functions.final_result with the action and comment included in the JSON.**Implementing tool call and response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the process now. First, I\u2019ll call the function in the \"commentary\" channel with the action to move north and my reasoning.

South would backtrack to the previous position, and East/West are blocked by walls.\"\n}\n\nAfter that, in the \"final\" channel, I\u2019ll present the same structured object as the final decision.

There's a '#' obstacle nearby, and when I check the adjacent cells, I see a wall to the north and east, but free spaces to the south and west. The goal is east, quite far away, and it's important to move in that direction. With the current communication limit, I need to choose an action that maximizes progress towards the goal.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nMoving east is blocked by a wall, so I can only go south or west. The southern patch is free, as is the western one. I need to make sure that if I move south to (19, 4), I won't run into a wall marked by '#'. So, I check the current patch: row 4 reveals an obstacle. Since (19, 4) corresponds to a wall, that move isn\u2019t possible. I need to reconsider my options.**Clarifying movement options**\n\nRow 4 at y=4 actually corresponds to row 3 in zero-based indexing, showing I'm free to move south to (19, 4). Additionally, moving west to (18, 3) is also an option. Both south and west are clear. However, since the goal is east, I'll need to navigate around the wall blocking that direction. But there's an obstacle at (20, 3) as well, fully blocking the route east. I have to rethink my approach to reach my goal.**Exploring movement paths**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether there's a path around the obstacles. If I move south from (19, 4) to (20, 4), that cell is blocked by a wall ('#'). Moving from (18, 3) to the east could lead me towards my goal, but I'd have to navigate around obstacles. If I first go south to (19, 4) and then try to continue to (19, 5), that spot is free as well. I need to keep analyzing these options!**Deciding movement direction**\n\nIt looks like I can't move east due to a wall at (20, 5) and the obstacles persist. The goal is to the east, but I can't access it directly. Since south (to 19, 4) is technically backtracking, I should explore other options. Moving west to (18, 3) avoids backtracking while still allowing me to progress towards my goal. From (18, 3), I see that moving south is also blocked, leaving west as my only viable move. So, I\u2019ll choose to move west!**Planning tool usage**\n\nI can send an INTENT message, but I need to focus on the output contract, which specifies just one action in the Decision object. I also need to include a comment explaining my reasoning. It's crucial to call a tool before finalizing my response. In this case, I\u2019ll use the `functions.final_result` tool to submit my decision to move west. After calling the tool, I won't output anything further in the final message beyond the Decision object itself. This should align with the required format!**Preparing action and comment**\n\nOkay, for the `final_result`, I need to construct an object with the required action and comment. The action will indicate a movement west, specifically formatted as { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"W\" }. \n\nMy comment will be a concise paragraph justifying this choice: \"Moved West to explore the open corridor since East is blocked by a wall and South would backtrack toward the recent position.

Moving West to (17,3) seems good because it\u2019s not in my recent positions list. The goal sensor indicates that the target is to the East and it's far away. However, safety is key and since East is a backtrack, I should choose to move West instead. This might not help progress toward the goal, but it\u2019s safer.**Constructing a Decision object**\n\nI need to create a Decision object with the action set to move. The model suggests the action could be defined as {kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"W\"}. Although I could consider including an \"INTENT,\" the rules advise keeping communication minimal. Therefore, I\u2019ll proceed with MOVE_W. I also want to add a comment explaining my reasoning in one paragraph. I\u2019ll say: \"I move west to avoid backtracking, as East is a previously visited cell. The north and south are blocked, so there's no need to focus on the distant goal for now.\"**Creating a concise Decision object**\n\nI need to ensure my response is concise while adhering to the requirements for the Decision model. The model isn't completely spelled out, but it likely has keys for action and comment. I'll structure it like this:\n\n{\n  \"action\": { \"kind\": \"MOVE\", \"direction\": \"W\" },\n  \"comment\": \"...\"\n}\n\nHowever, I should remember that I need to call a function tool as part of the response, even if it seems unnecessary. So, I\u2019ll call functions.final_result with the decision as my next step!**Using the tool to create a decision**\n\nI need to confirm that the tool is used to generate the final structured decision. The instructions clearly indicate I must call one of the defined function tools, even if it doesn't seem relevant. So, I'll aim to call functions.final_result with the planned action. Once the tool returns, I typically wouldn't output anything else. It expects input with both action and comment, and I need to ensure that the final output is the structured Decision object as required.**Defining the tool call process**\n\nI need to make sure I route correctly to the \"commentary\" channel for the tool call before moving to the \"final\" channel for the response. The functions tool, \"final_result,\" returns some JSON that I need to use as final content. I plan to create a structured action with direction set for West and craft a comment explaining why. It should clearly state that North and South are blocked, and moving East means backtracking. After calling the tool, I\u2019ll present the final Decision object. It seems there may be redundancy in presenting content, but I need to ensure that the final output matches what\u2019s expected!**Planning the decision output**\n\nI need to ensure that the Decision gets placed in the final message while possibly ignoring the tool's response. The system expects me to execute a tool in the same turn and return the final decision. I should call functions.final_result in the \"commentary\" channel with the Decision object containing the action and comment. After that, I must present the same object in the final message. The tool's response might be useful for evaluation, but the final output will be the structured Decision object.

Both North and South from this position seem clear, but I need to consider any walls that might pose a risk. The goal is to head East, but moving North or South could lead to a dead end later. So, I should choose an action that minimizes backtracking while keeping the goal in mind.**Evaluating movement options**\n\nI see there's a corridor at column x=17, and at (17,2) it's free while (17,1) may be blocked above. The grid shows that moving North to (17,1) keeps me inside the patch, and the row at y=1 is clear. Moving South to (17,4) also leads to open space at (17,5). The goal is East, but I can\u2019t do that right now because of a backtracking constraint. Between going North or South, I think heading North might be safer for detecting obstacles.**Deciding on movement**\n\nI need to remember that I can only move one step per turn and have to decide whether to go North or South. Avoiding immediate backtracking is key, but both options seem safe. The goal is East, and while moving North might explore away from the goal temporarily, it may maintain my path. A good rule is to prefer movements toward the goal if they\u2019re safe, but moving East would backtrack. So, I\u2019ll choose to MOVE_N.

However, I'm not fully familiar with the \"Decision model\" format defined for this. The functions tool uses a standardized output called \"final_result,\" which means I need to create a structured object that includes \"action\" and other required fields. I\u2019ll return a \"MOVE\" with direction \"N.\" For the final result, it should look like this: { action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"N\" }, comment: \"...\"}. The decision model requires specific fields, so I\u2019ll stick to that structure!**Preparing decision structure**\n\nThe tool `functions.final_result` requires a structure with an \"action\" field and a \"comment.\" I need to ensure the \"comment\" is included correctly in the top-level object.

To summarize: North is free, East has a wall, South is free, and West has a wall. This means I can potentially move North or South. I think checking bounds isn't necessary since there's no wall where I'm moving. It's also good that I don't have to worry about colliding with other agents since the neighbors' view is empty. But I must consider that the goal is to the East, although I can't move there because of the wall. I should choose an action that maximizes my team's progress.**Analyzing safe movement options**\n\nI'm considering safe directions to move: North, South, or Stay. I need to look at the recent positions, which list the last five positions in reverse order: (17,2), (17,3), (18,3), (19,3), and (19,4). Okay, I see my current position is (17,2), which makes sense. If I move North to (17,1), it seems there's a risk of backtracking. Moving South to (17,3) looks more promising since it\u2019s a recent position and aligns with the intended movement downwards in this grid.**Avoiding backtracking**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the path seems a bit inconsistent right now, and I need to avoid backtracking immediately. I can't go back to (17,3) since my last position before arriving at (17,2) was indeed (17,3). The rules require me to use the last five positions to avoid moving back unless that's the only option. The logs show I arrived at (17,2) after moving from (17,3), so going back would just retrace my steps. It\u2019s important to stick to this rule!**Determining the best move**\n\nGoing North from (17,2) to (17,1) wouldn\u2019t be an immediate backtrack since I\u2019m not going back to (17,3). Instead, moving South to (17,3) would qualify as backtracking because that was my last position. Both North and South are accessible, but I should avoid moving South to (17,3). I\u2019ll aim for North to (17,1), which is in the clear based on the patch information. Plus, (17,1) is free according to the grid boundaries, so it\u2019s the best move!**Formulating the Decision object**\n\nI'm considering that while my goal is toward the East, moving North seems safe and aligns with maximizing team progress. My next step is to create a Decision object for this movement. I need to structure it with the action type and include a comment. The best choice is to move North, so I\u2019ll prepare the required JSON format.\n\nNow, I'll ensure my function call includes both the action and an appropriate comment, even though the comment is likely just a brief explanation of my choice. My plan is to call `functions.final_result` with the action to move North and then output this Decision in the final message. I'll create a concise action description too.**Preparing the Decision object**\n\nI realize the tool requires a \"comment\" field, so I need to include a comment string with my action. I\u2019ll propose a Decision object that outlines my intention to move North. The comment should clarify that moving North avoids backtracking and opens options for progressing toward the East goal later.\n\nI will format the Decision object as follows: \n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"N\" },\n  comment: \"Move north to avoid backtracking into the previous cell and to stay in safe free space, preserving options for progress toward the goal bearing east on later turns.\"\n}\n\nI\u2019ll call `functions.final_result` first, and then output the structured Decision object in the final channel.

The layout includes solid walls and an agent located at (2,1). The current view has no available goal or neighbors, and I must choose an action to move toward the goal. The options are to move east, south, or west. I want to avoid backtracking, as the agent's last moves were from (18,3) to (17,1). Let's find the best option to progress!**Determining the next move**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which direction will help progress toward the goal. The goal bearing is unavailable, and it seems like the goal isn't adjacent. I've got to avoid backtracking to (18,3), which suggests moving east. However, going east from (17,1) leads to (18,1), which I haven't approached recently. My last move was north to (17,1), and backtracking north to (17,0) isn\u2019t viable either because of the wall. Therefore, I must avoid backtracking unless absolutely necessary.**Analyzing backtracking options**\n\nI've established that my immediate previous position is (17,2). To backtrack from (17,1) to (17,2), I would need to move south, but I'm wondering if that's considered backtracking. The last moves were from (17,3) to (17,2) and then north to (17,1). Backtracking really means retracing your steps, so I should avoid moving south to (17,2) unless it's the only safe option available. I need to consider any other possible moves first!**Deciding on a direction**\n\nI have the options to move east to (18,1), west to (16,1), or south to (17,2). Moving south feels like backtracking, which isn\u2019t ideal. The east and west options could both lead me closer to the goal, but I don\u2019t know where the goal is exactly. The problem mentions we should communicate minimally, but I don\u2019t have any messages. Since all three options (E, W, S) are open, I\u2019ll focus on choosing either E or W since both directions are free and safe.**Crafting the decision**\n\nI need to decide whether to move east to (18,1) or explore west to (16,1). Since moving south would mean backtracking, I want to avoid that. I\u2019ll opt for moving east since it could be more promising and the path is clear. Considering all this, I\u2019ll set up a decision object where I move east and comment that I\u2019m choosing that direction due to the wall blocking north and the opportunity for progress. Now, I\u2019ll call the tool with this decision!**Preparing the function call**\n\nI\u2019m set to call the function with my decision to move east. In my comment, I\u2019ll explain that I\u2019m choosing to move in that direction because the north cell is blocked by a wall, and backtracking would waste potential progress.

If I want to backtrack, I\u2019d need to go back to (17,1) by moving West. Since moving West would mean going back, it\u2019s best to avoid it unless there\u2019s no other safe option. The East to (19,1) is open, while North and South are blocked. So, I should choose to MOVE East. I need to check there's no agent in that space, and since it\u2019s marked FREE, it\u2019s safe to proceed. Communicating my intentions could be helpful but isn't mandatory.**Deciding on communication**\n\nIf I decide to communicate, I should send an INTENT message. However, I can also choose not to communicate, which meets the rules. The rules clarify to send only what\u2019s necessary if I do decide to communicate. My best option seems to be to proceed with a MOVE East action. I\u2019ll set my action as:  \n```  \n{  \n  kind: \"MOVE\",  \n  direction: \"E\"  \n}  \n```  \nBut I also need to consider the final result, which requires an action for this turn and possibly a comment. However, the output structure doesn\u2019t seem to accommodate a comment, which is puzzling.**Understanding the final response structure**\n\nI realize that the final_response schema includes an action and a comment. The user wants me to return a single structured object that aligns with the `Decision` model. The tools I have to work with confirm that the `final_result` needs both an action and a comment. To do this, I need to call the correct function, which means I should create a payload like:  \n```  \naction: {kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\"}, comment: \"...\"  \n```  \nAlthough I could use the multi_tool_use.parallel for multiple calls, I only need to call a single function, functions.final_result, with this payload to proceed correctly.**Clarifying tool response process**\n\nSo, after I call the tool, I\u2019ll get its return, and then I\u2019m supposed to respond to the user with that. The common pattern I see is to call the tool and then include its output in my final message. The instructions are clear that I need to yield to the user after the tool runs. It looks like I need to present the tool\u2019s \"final_result\" as the \"Decision\" object, structured in JSON format. This ensures the user gets relevant content directly.**Finalizing tool call process**\n\nI think I need to call functions.final_result for the movement, and the tool will respond with something I should forward to the user. The instructions say to create a single structured object that fits the `Decision` model. After calling the tool, I'll need to produce a final message that matches the tool's output. \n\nI\u2019ll set my action to move East and include a comment explaining my reasoning about why that direction is safe and preferable. The comment field is optional in the JSON structure, but I'll fill it in to clarify my thought process. So I\u2019ll call:\n\n```  \nfunctions.final_result({  \n  action: {  \n    kind: \"MOVE\",  \n    direction: \"E\"  \n  },  \n  comment: \"East is the only safe non-backtracking option; North and South are walls and West would backtrack to the previous cell (17,1).\"  \n});  \n```  \n\nOnce I have the tool's response, I should present that as my final answer, following the standard pattern of calling the tool, waiting for the response, and then sharing it with the user.**Implementing final action call**\n\nI\u2019m ready to implement my action! First, I\u2019ll call functions.final_result with the following parameters:  \n\n```  \n{  \n  action: {  \n    kind: \"MOVE\",  \n    direction: \"E\"  \n  },  \n  comment: \"East is the only safe non-backtracking option (North and South are walls; West would revisit the previous cell). Moving East advances toward the goal bearing SE while respecting proximity and turn constraints.\"  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis comment fits the requirement of being one paragraph and has two sentences, so I think it works well.

The rows are organized from bottom to top, with 5 rows in total. Row0 and Row1 are walls, and in Row2, I see my agent 'A' at (20,2). But there's inconsistency; the absolute position given is (20,1). This suggests there might be a coordinate mismatch because the patch's positioning conflicts with the self-state's absolute position.**Evaluating patch coordinates**\n\nIt looks like the patch coordinates are causing some confusion. The agent \"A\" is at (20,2), while the absolute position is noted as (20,1). This could be due to indexing differences. The adjacent statuses indicate that there are walls to the North and South, but the East (to (21,1)) is free, as is the West (to (19,1)). Since moving East aligns with the goal direction, it seems like the best choice while avoiding backtracking. So, I should plan to MOVE_E!**Deciding on actions**\n\nI\u2019m considering the limitations of \"MAX_outbound_per_turn,\" which is set to 1, meaning we can only move once. I think the best course is to decide on a \"MOVE\" action to the East. While I could broadcast an \"INTENT\" for collision avoidance, it seems unnecessary since I\u2019m the only agent here. Even though sharing could help a team, I don\u2019t need to communicate right now, so I\u2019ll simply proceed with the MOVE action.**Issuing action decision**\n\nI\u2019m ready to issue a MOVE_E action without sending extra messages. To explain my reasoning, I\u2019ll provide a brief comment: \u201cI chose MOVE_E because both North and South have walls, but East is free. Moving towards the goal in that direction helps avoid backtracking.\u201d I\u2019ll create one Decision object containing this action. Finally, I need to call the functions.final_result with the decision payload to complete the process before yielding the result to the user.**Preparing action call**\n\nI need to check the adjacent statuses again, and since East is free, it\u2019s a safe move.

I\u2019m wondering about the safest direction to move. Going south (to y=2) seems free, while moving west could lead to backtracking. Since south is available, it makes sense to choose that route. The goal is east but blocked by a wall. So, I think I'll go with MOVE_S and document my reasoning while considering what the \"Decision\" model entails.**Structuring action parameters**\n\nI need to define a structure with fields for actions, probably including MOVE with a direction, STAY, or COMMUNICATE. The final tool I'm working with expects an action parameter in the format {kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"S\"}. When calling functions.final_result, I'll specify that the action is to move one step along a cardinal axis. For now, I\u2019m choosing MOVE_S. I also need to consider adding an optional \"comment\" in the Decision model to clarify the action.**Defining final result structure**\n\nThe \"final_result\" structure I need should look like this: { action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"S\" }, comment: \"...\" The schema indicates there's an action field, and we can include a comment. So, I'll call functions.final_result with an action specifying the southward move and give a comment explaining my reasoning.\n\nI'll say something like, \"South is the only safe move that avoids backtracking. North and East are blocked by walls, and West would lead to the previous position.\" Keeping it concise with two sentences is key here!**Crafting the decision output**\n\nThe instructions are clear that the comment should be one paragraph with 1-3 sentences. I'll write, \"South is the only safe move that avoids backtracking; North and East are blocked by walls, and West leads back to the previous position. This choice allows for progress towards the goal bearing to the East while avoiding collisions.\" \n\nNext, I need to return a single structured object that fits the `Decision` model without adding extra text. The platform expects a JSON-like Decision object, and I\u2019ll need to call the tool to handle this properly!**Implementing the decision process**\n\nThe system requires me to use tools before finalizing the output as a Decision object without extra text. I need to ensure that I call the functions.final_result with my decision to move south along with the comment. This should look like this:  \n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"S\" },\n  comment: \"South is the only safe non-backtracking move; East and North are walls, and West leads back to the previous position.\"\n}  \n\nThen, in the final message, I will also replicate the Decision object in JSON format.

I\u2019m constructing this JSON-like object with fields for the action and a comment explaining my reasoning. I\u2019ll ensure that the action matches the required format and keeps it structured without extra fields. So, I'll include the specified action and a reasoning comment.**Crafting the Decision object**\n\nI need to consider \"EXECUTION RULE 5,\" using sensors and nearby elements to inform my decision. Since the goal bearing is east and moving in that direction is safe, I'll finalize my Decision. The Decision object will include an action to move East and a comment explaining that this direction avoids backtracking and aligns with the goal. However, I also have to ensure that I produce only one Decision object, which means I\u2019ll need to call the final_result tool correctly. But wait, how can I call a tool if I haven\u2019t computed yet?**Finalizing action execution**\n\nI see that the tool requires an \"Action\" to execute for this turn, and the Decision object is the result of that action. In this environment, I absolutely need to call one of the function tools right away. Typically, I would call functions.final_result with my decision to get an acknowledgment. But I have to do this before yielding a response to the user, not after crafting my final message. So, it\u2019s clear: I need to call the tool now to proceed with the Decision output.**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI\u2019ve realized that usually, I call the function with the intended decision, and then the assistant ends the turn without further messages. However, I still need to provide a final response after the tool returns. It seems the tool call must happen in the commentary channel, and I must output the final content afterward. The pattern is clear: call functions.final_result with the Decision object and then provide the final structured object as the decision in plain text. \n\nSo, let\u2019s finalize the Decision object, ensuring it conveys the movement and reasoning clearly.

It looks like \"neighbors_in_view\" and \"artifacts_in_view\" are empty, and the recent positions cover a path from (20,1) to (23,2). So, based on the rule of avoiding backtracking, I shouldn't return to (22,2) or (21,2) unless it's the only option. I'm figuring out the adjacent states: N is free, E is a wall, S is free, and W is also free, while trying to clarify grid orientation.**Interpreting the grid layout**\n\nI'm looking at the adjacent list for each N/E/S/W cell relative to the agent. For North (N), I initially thought the cell was at (x, y+1), but it seems standard practice is y-1 for movement. The agent's position is defined as \"A\" in the patch at row 2, column 2, which checks out. The absolute position matches up too! Now, I need to decide on a move, with N, S, and W being free, while E is a wall. There could be walls affecting boundaries too.**Assessing movement options toward the goal**\n\nThe patch indicates wall cells with a '#', and with a maximum range of 2, the goal is to the east (bearing \"E\"). However, there's a wall adjacent in that direction. So, while the goal might be further east, the wall is blocking access. The bearing tells me where the goal is in relation to the environment, but it doesn't affect the path. I need to choose between moving North, South, West, or Staying, since moving East isn't viable.**Checking for collisions and movement options**\n\nI need to ensure there are no collisions with other agents nearby. Adjacency shows that moving East is blocked by a wall. The safe moves are North to (23,3), South to (23,1), or West to (22,2). To avoid backtracking, I\u2019m checking my recent positions, and my last move was to (22,2) from (23,2). Since heading back to (22,2) would mean moving West, I should avoid that if I can move North or South instead for a better option.**Navigating around obstacles**\n\nI need to consider the goal bearing East, which means the target is that way, but there's a wall blocking direct movement. I can't go East but might navigate around it later on. I see three possible moves: North to (23,3), South to (23,1), or West to (22,2). However, moving West would just be backtracking. Since both North and South are free, I need to decide which move will best progress me toward the goal, given the wall in the East. North seems promising as it could open further paths.I'm deciding whether to move North or South, and since both options avoid backtracking, I'm considering the best route to gradually approach the goal in the East. Moving South to (23,1) offers a corridor under the agent, allowing a potentially clear path to the East while avoiding walls. From (23,1), I'll have a way to continue East.

However, I want to avoid backtracking to (23,2) since that was my last position. My aim is to progress toward the goal located to the East, which makes moving East to (24,3) the best choice. So, I\u2019ll decide to move in the East direction and prepare to output that decision!**Structuring the decision model**\n\nI need to follow the Decision model, which requires returning a structured object.

If I move west to (23,3), that would actually be returning to the last position, which is backtracking. So, avoiding (23,3) is wise. Moving east is safe and not considered backtracking. With S and N blocked, the best move is east. However, I need to think about the goal's direction, which is northeast. Moving east to (25,3) could change my bearing toward that goal, even if it takes more than one step. Communication might not be necessary right now.**Deciding on communication**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether we need to send a communication at all. The rule suggests only communicating if necessary, and if we do, it should be minimal. The Decision model is clear: I need to deliver a single object with a specific action. I\u2019ll create a Decision object with fields like action, which can be STAY or MOVE_E, among others. So, I've decided to go with MOVE_E as the action since it feels appropriate.**Planning the action call**\n\nI'm setting up the action for moving east. The decision is based on the goal direction, which is northeast, and considering that north and south are blocked, while west would be backtracking. Moving east seems safe and avoids collisions. I don't need to communicate or announce intent since it\u2019s a straightforward move. I\u2019ll ensure to call the function tool correctly, using functions.final_result with the action and a concise reasoning comment in one paragraph. Just one tool is sufficient for this.**Crafting the action plan**\n\nI\u2019m formulating the action to move east. This avoids backtracking to the recent position (23,3) and uses the only free neighboring cell. It also aligns with the northeast goal while other options are blocked. Great, that\u2019s a solid two-sentence explanation! Next, I\u2019ll need to call functions.final_result with this action. In my final message to the user, I should return the structured Decision object, ensuring to output the tool's response directly after calling it. It feels important to follow the instructions carefully!**Planning the tool call**\n\nI need to perform a tool call first, and then I\u2019ll output the final Decision object. The process involves calling functions.final_result in the commentary channel, and once the tool responds, I\u2019ll present the Decision object in the final channel.

I've got walls to the North and South, but free paths to East and West, which makes me focus on those directions. There\u2019s a goal to the Northeast from my position. The grid layout suggests I\u2019m in the middle, and the goal is within a distance of about 2 units to the Northeast. However, I need to make sure I don\u2019t collide with any walls while moving towards it.**Deciding on movement actions**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing that I have no neighbors or artifacts in view, and the inbox is empty, but I can see my goal sensor indicating a Northeast bearing with mid-strength. The goal could be within reach if I move East or West. I need to choose a single action: MOVE_E, MOVE_W, or STAY. I also want to avoid backtracking, as my last five positions show that moving back East would retrace my steps. So, I should consider the best option without retracing my recent movements.**Analyzing movement options**\n\nConsidering my possible moves, both East and West are free, but I want to avoid immediate backtracking to (24,3). The recent positions suggest that returning West would lead me back to where I just came from. Moving East to (26,3) seems more favorable since it isn't on my recent list. Plus, my goal sensor indicates a Northeast direction, which could help me find a path forward. I need to keep the walls in mind, but East appears to be the best option for progress.**Determining the best movement**\n\nI see the goal is in the Northeast quadrant, but moving directly East or West won't get me closer to that direction necessarily. However, going East to (26,3) seems like a solid option since it\u2019s free of agents and my adjacent cells don\u2019t show any blockers. My inbox and neighbors are clear as well. I think my best move here is to decide on East. I may also consider a minimal communication, but that\u2019s optional. I'll finalize the decision to MOVE East now.**Preparing the decision object**\n\nI'm ready to create my decision object for moving East. The object will specify that the action is a MOVE in the East direction. I also need to include a comment explaining my reasoning in one paragraph.

The adjacent directions are labeled: North is a WALL, East is FREE, South is a WALL, and West is FREE. So, I can either move East to (27,3), which is open, or West to (25,3), also free. North has a WALL, and South is a WALL too. So, I can only go East, West, or stay in place.**Evaluating recent positions and moves**\n\nI've got the last five positions of my agent: (26,3), (25,3), (24,3), (23,3), and (23,2). The most recent move was from (26,3) to (25,3). Now I see that the current position is still (26,3), so if I move West back to (25,3), it would be backtracking, which is usually discouraged unless it's safe. The only safe moves are East or West, but since West is backtracking, it's better to go East to (27,3) instead. Also, the goal sensor indicates a NE bearing, which could help guide me too.**Deciding on movement and communication**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to move East to (27,3) since that's a free space. The goal is located at (28,1), which is to the NE from my current position (26,3). I could approach the goal, but there's a wall to the North. I could also consider sending a minimal intent message about my move to the East, but I don't see any reason to communicate since my inbox is empty and there are no artifacts in view. Communication isn\u2019t mandatory here.**Making a decision on movement**\n\nI\u2019ve decided not to communicate to stay within inbound limits, so my only action will be to MOVE East. I need to create the Decision object and fill in the necessary fields. For the action structure, it should reflect the FINAL tool format, specifically as a MOVE with a direction. I'll output an object like this: {kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\"}. Then, I\u2019ll include a comment string that summarizes my reasoning in one cohesive paragraph.**Constructing the Decision object**\n\nI plan to output the Decision object now. My action will be to move East, formatted like this:  \n```json\n{ \n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"E\" }, \n  comment: \"I chose to move east to avoid walls to the north and south, as well as backtracking to the west. This helps me progress toward the visible goal area while staying within bounds.\"\n}\n```  \nNext, I need to execute this using the functions.final_result tool in the commentary channel. The final output will be the structured Decision object, adhering to the required format, and I'll ensure to follow the steps correctly.**Formulating the Decision object**\n\nI\u2019m crafting my Decision object now. I'm choosing to move East to (27,3). The north and south neighbors are walls, and going west would backtrack to a recently visited cell. So, moving East keeps me on track toward the goal located northeast in the visible patch. Here\u2019s what my object will look like:  \n```json\n{\n  \"action\": { \"kind\": \"MOVE\", \"direction\": \"E\" },\n  \"comment\": \"Move East to (27,3) because N and S are walls, W would backtrack to a recently visited cell, and East provides safe forward progress toward the goal area within the visible patch.\"\n}\n```  \nNow, I\u2019ll call the functions.final_result tool in the commentary channel, and then I will output the same structured object in the final channel.

The goal is at (28,1), which is NE from my position. I can't move North due to the wall, but moving East to (28,3) is possible since it\u2019s free and not an obstacle. So, I'll choose to move East to (28,3).**Evaluating movement options**\n\nI've identified that moving South to (27,4) and West to (26,3) are both safe options based on their state as free. However, I need to avoid backtracking to my recent positions. The recent position list shows that I just came from (26,3) and (27,3). Therefore, moving back to (26,3) isn\u2019t a good idea since that would be immediate backtracking. I have three safe moves: East, South, or West, but I really need to steer clear of going back.**Choosing direction wisely**\n\nI\u2019m considering the order of my recent positions to avoid backtracking. Although (26,3) is my previous step, I shouldn\u2019t move there since it\u2019s not the only safe option. I want to maximize my movement toward the goal located at (28,1). The options are East to (28,3) or South to (27,4), both of which are new positions. The goal is diagonally at NE, so I\u2019ll focus on moving toward either East or South to progress effectively.**Deciding on direction**\n\nI'm analyzing my next steps based on the goal at (28,1) and how to get closer. Moving East to (28,3) will reduce my Manhattan distance to the goal, even though it moves me further along the y-coordinate. From (27,3), my distance to the goal is about 2.24, and moving to (28,3) reduces that to 2. I see no other agents around, so I\u2019ll choose to move East since that seems like the best option right now.**Planning final actions**\n\nI need to ensure I create a structured decision about my move. If I decide to communicate, I must send a minimal valid message, but moving East seems logical without needing additional communication. I'll set up my decision object to move East, with a comment explaining my reasoning for that choice. The comment should clearly state that I'm avoiding the wall to the north, not backtracking, and that this move aligns with my goal. Now, I\u2019ll call the necessary function to finalize this decision.**Preparing final Decision object**\n\nIn this setup, I need to first make the tool call and then respond with my final Decision object. The tool's return will help me finalize my content. Once I get the tool's output, I\u2019ll present the Decision object, which I've prepared. It includes moving East since North is a wall and avoids backtracking. I\u2019ll make sure to write a clear comment explaining how moving East keeps me safe and reduces the distance to the goal.

That\u2019s puzzling! Maybe there\u2019s some kind of illusion? I still know there's a 'G' at (28,1), which is straightforward. But moving north is blocked by a wall. My options are moving east to (29,3) or west to (27,3), so I'm assessing whether there are any obstacles.**Evaluating surroundings and movement**\n\nI've noted the patch shows \"..A.#\" and that \"A\" is at the position (2) of my current row, but that\u2019s not crucial right now. The cell east at (29,3) is free, and I\u2019m currently at (2,3). I realized that the patch represents a radius of 2 around the center at (2,2). \n\nAlthough there's no goal mentioned, the sensor indicates northeast, so it might be best to consider moving east or west. My recent positions show consistent movement to the west. They start from (24,3) to my current spot (28,3).**Confirming movement history**\n\nI've realized that I moved from (24,3) to (28,3) by going east four steps, which means my last four moves were to the east. The path reflects that: (24,3), (25,3), (26,3), (27,3), and finally (28,3). Since (27,3) is my most recent position, I should avoid backtracking there because that would be an immediate return to a previous cell, which isn\u2019t a good strategy. So, I have to decide whether to stay or make a new move to (29,3).**Deciding on movement**\n\nSince east is clear, I should opt for MOVE_E. I have to think about potential collisions with other agents, but there's no one in my way right now as the \"neighbors_in_view\" and \"inbox\" are both empty. The goal sensor indicates a northeast direction, but I can\u2019t go north. Moving east seems like the best option to eventually align with the northeast goal. \n\nI\u2019ll need to create a decision object indicating my action as \"MOVE\" in the \"E\" direction. So, my action will be: ACTION: kind MOVE, direction \"E\".**Crafting decision details**\n\nI need to create a comment for my decision to move east. I\u2019m thinking something like, \u201cI chose to move east because north and south are blocked. Backtracking west would negate my progress, so I\u2019ll move east, which is safe and continues toward the goal.\u201d \n\nI must remember to use the tool function, functions.final_result, to produce the decision object but ensure I call it first. The structure will include my action \u201cMOVE\u201d east along with my comment to keep everything clear and concise. After the tool call, I'll provide only the decision object in the final output.**Executing the tool call**\n\nI need to call the tool correctly first, following the rule that requires a tool call before yielding a response. It seems the tool response is internal and not visible to the user, so I\u2019ll focus on structuring my input properly. I\u2019m calling functions.final_result with my decision parameters about moving east.

The goal location 'G' is at (28,1). To reach this goal cell, I would need to move northwest diagonally, but only cardinal moves are allowed. From (29,2), I see (28,2) is a wall, blocking westward movement. Instead, I can go north to (29,1), which is open. Then, I would be able to move west to the goal at (28,1). But I wonder if there are any specific constraints regarding the goal cell being passable.**Evaluating goal visibility**\n\nI usually think moving into a cell marked as the goal would complete the objective. However, I'm wondering if the goal is in any immediate neighbors. From (29,1), there's the goal to the west at (28,1), but my current sensor can't detect it. The adjacent states show north, south, and west as free, while east is blocked. Since (28,1) is not marked as adjacent, it means I can't enter the goal in a single step. So, it seems I'll need to plan my moves accordingly.**Choosing the best move**\n\nI need to pick a move that maximizes my long-term progress. Moving north seems like a solid choice since it will bring me closer to the goal while avoiding backtracking. From my current position at y=3, moving north to y=2, and then to y=1 reduces my distance. Nevertheless, I have to think about obstacles: both (29,2) and (29,1) are free, allowing me to reach (28,1), which is the goal. But is that goal cell considered passable? The goal sensor might provide direction to approach it.**Deciding on the best move**\n\nThe northwest bearing indicates that the goal is roughly in that direction. By moving north, I'm decreasing my y-coordinate effectively. If I were to go west, I'd end up at (28,3), which is free, but that would mean backtracking, so I want to avoid that. The best choice is to move north. \n\nI can create a Decision object with the action set as MOVE_N. This object structure would look like this:\n\n{\n  action: { kind: \"MOVE\", direction: \"N\" },\n  comment: \"...\"\n}\n\nSince there are no other agents nearby, it's safe to proceed!**Finalizing the decision**\n\nI\u2019m considering the \"inbox\" messages, and it seems they're empty.

First, I have to call a tool from the functions namespace to comply with the requirement of calling one of the defined function tools.\n\nLooking at the OBSERVATION_JSON, I see the protocol version, turn index, grid size, and self-state. The patch shows relative cells around my agent, and I need to ensure that the patch is centered correctly, covering the right x and y coordinates based on the radius size. So, the agent \u201cA\u201d is located properly within the identified patch.**Analyzing agent's position**\n\nIn Row 2 of my observation, I see that the agent \"A\" is positioned at (29, 2), which matches the calculated coordinates. I've mapped adjacent states and noted that the north cell is free, but the east is out of bounds. Moving down, I've also confirmed that the cell to the south is free and the west cell is a wall. \n\nLooking at recent positions, it appears the agent moved north from (29, 3) to (29, 2). Additionally, the goal sensor indicates a near goal at a northwest bearing, which is good information to have!**Identifying goals and surroundings**\n\nIn the local patch, Row 1 shows a 'G' at (28, 1), indicating a goal nearby. The cells in Row 2 confirm the agent \"A\" is at (29, 2). Looking at the surrounding rows, Row 0 is all walls, while Row 3 has open cells at columns 0, 1, and 2. Row 4 also has openings at (28, 4) and (27, 4). \n\nFrom position (29, 2), the adjacent north cell (29, 1) is indeed free, allowing movement towards the goal at (28, 1).**Analyzing movement options**\n\nTo figure out my next moves, I see that the east is blocked, the south is at (29, 3) which is free, and the west has a wall at (28, 2). This means the available moves are north and south. The goal is located at (28, 1), positioned northwest from my current location (29, 2), which is two diagonal steps away. \n\nI want to avoid backtracking based on my recent positions, so I'll need to decide on an action that maximizes my progress towards that goal. The order of the recent positions is important to keep in mind.**Deciding next action**\n\nI need to avoid backtracking, so I can\u2019t move back to (29, 3) since that\u2019s my last position. My options are moving north to (29, 1) or south to (29, 3), but if I go north, I ultimately move towards the goal at (28, 1).\n\nThe north move to (29, 1) is free, and from there, I can reach the goal at (28, 1). It\u2019s clear that proceeding north is the better choice. Thus, I\u2019ll format a Decision object stating: action \"MOVE\" with direction \"N\", and then output that through the final result tool.**Structuring the decision object**\n\nI need to call the functions.final_result to log my action and then format the Decision object correctly for output. The plan is to capture my reasoning in a single paragraph while ensuring clarity about my movement toward the goal. \n\nI\u2019ll state that moving north keeps me progressing toward the NW goal, mentioning that the southern path is backtracking and providing rationale about walls and boundaries blocking other options. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll call the tool with a structured decision object, then confirm that the same decision will go out in the final response.", "id": "reasoning", "signature": null, "provider_name": "openrouter", "part_kind": "thinking"}, {"tool_name": "final_result", "args": "{\"action\":{\"kind\":\"MOVE\",\"direction\":\"N\"},\"comment\":\"Move north to (29,1) as the northern cell is free and maintains progress toward the NW goal bearing.

I need to ensure there are no conflicts. The goal sensor indicates that the goal is indeed nearby in that direction. While I could move South to (29,2), that\u2019s in my recent positions list, and backtracking there isn't allowed unless it's my only option.
