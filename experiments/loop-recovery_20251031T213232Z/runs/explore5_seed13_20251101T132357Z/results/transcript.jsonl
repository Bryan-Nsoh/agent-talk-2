{"turn": 0, "agent_id": "a5", "prompt": "OBJECTIVE:\nKeep the entire team safe and moving. \u201cProgress\u201d means avoiding stalemates, exploring new corridors, and guiding everyone to the goal\u2014sometimes by stepping away from it temporarily. The episode ends after 60 turns; a timeout is a failure even if some agents reach the goal.\n\nMISSION BRIEF:\n- Grid awareness comes from the JSON: `grid_size`, `local_patch`, and `adjacent` describe nearby tiles; `self_state` gives your orientation.\n- Actions: MOVE_N/E/S/W, STAY, COMMUNICATE (one message per turn within radio range), optional artifacts (e.g., NO_GO cones) to warn teammates.\n- Collisions (BLOCK_AGENT or SWAP_CONFLICT) reset you, waste a turn, and often leave NO_GO markers. `contended_neighbors` indicates recent conflict directions.\n- History: `history` holds your last turns with a `loop` counter and notes; `recent_positions` lists the cells you just visited.\n- Goal sensor (`goal_sensor`) is a noisy hint. Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3. EXPLORE: Prefer safe tiles you haven\u2019t occupied recently to open new paths and relieve congestion.\n4. ADVANCE TOWARD GOAL: Only after you are loop-free and clear of hazards should you follow the goal bearing or Manhattan gradient.\n\nLOOP ESCAPE EXAMPLE:\n- Turn t: `history.loop = 3`, last intents [MOVE_E, MOVE_W, MOVE_E]. Action: MOVE_N; comment \u201cAVOID_LOOP; exploring north to clear congestion.\u201d Optionally COMMUNICATE \u201crerouting north to break loop.\u201d\n- Turn t+1: loop resets to 0 \u2192 reassess hazards, then resume goal-oriented planning.\n\nCOMMENT & COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES:\n- Begin comments with a status token (e.g., \u201cOK;\u201d, \u201cBLOCKED_AGENT(\u2026)\u201d) and keep them \u226425 words.\n- When you take a detour or STAY to break a loop, explain it so teammates know you\u2019re clearing space. Use COMMUNICATE to broadcast reroutes, hazards, or intent when appropriate.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not output any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, NO_GO markers, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3. Consult `adjacent` (NESW labels) plus `recent_positions` to avoid immediate backtracking unless it is the only safe option.\n4. Use `history`, `goal_sensor`, `neighbors_in_view`, `artifacts_in_view`, and `inbox` to inform your choice.\n5. If you COMMUNICATE, send the minimal helpful message.\n6.
