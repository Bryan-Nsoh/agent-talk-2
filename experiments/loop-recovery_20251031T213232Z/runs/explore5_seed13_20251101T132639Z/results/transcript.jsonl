Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3.

The episode ends after 60 turns; a timeout is a failure even if some agents reach the goal.\n\nMISSION BRIEF:\n- Grid awareness comes from the JSON: `grid_size`, `local_patch`, and `adjacent` describe nearby tiles; `self_state` gives your orientation.\n- Actions: MOVE_N/E/S/W, STAY, COMMUNICATE (one message per turn within radio range), optional artifacts (e.g., NO_GO cones) to warn teammates.\n- Collisions (BLOCK_AGENT or SWAP_CONFLICT) reset you, waste a turn, and often leave NO_GO markers. `contended_neighbors` indicates recent conflict directions.\n- History: `history` holds your last turns with a `loop` counter and notes; `recent_positions` lists the cells you just visited.\n- Goal sensor (`goal_sensor`) is a noisy hint. Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3. EXPLORE: Prefer safe tiles you haven\u2019t occupied recently to open new paths and relieve congestion.\n4. ADVANCE TOWARD GOAL: Only after you are loop-free and clear of hazards should you follow the goal bearing or Manhattan gradient.\n\nLOOP ESCAPE EXAMPLE:\n- Turn t: `history.loop = 3`, last intents [MOVE_E, MOVE_W, MOVE_E]. Action: MOVE_N; comment \u201cAVOID_LOOP; exploring north to clear congestion.\u201d Optionally COMMUNICATE \u201crerouting north to break loop.\u201d\n- Turn t+1: loop resets to 0 \u2192 reassess hazards, then resume goal-oriented planning.\n\nCOMMENT & COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES:\n- Begin comments with a status token (e.g., \u201cOK;\u201d, \u201cBLOCKED_AGENT(\u2026)\u201d) and keep them \u226425 words.\n- When you take a detour or STAY to break a loop, explain it so teammates know you\u2019re clearing space. Use COMMUNICATE to broadcast reroutes, hazards, or intent when appropriate.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not output any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, NO_GO markers, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3. Consult `adjacent` (NESW labels) plus `recent_positions` to avoid immediate backtracking unless it is the only safe option.\n4. Use `history`, `goal_sensor`, `neighbors_in_view`, `artifacts_in_view`, and `inbox` to inform your choice.\n5. If you COMMUNICATE, send the minimal helpful message.\n6. Populate `comment` with one concise paragraph (1\u20133 sentences) explaining your reasoning for this turn.\n\nQUALITY GATE:\nReturn exactly one `Decision` object that validates.\n\nFINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\nEmit only the structured `Decision` object.\n\n=== INPUTS ===\nCOMMUNICATION_RULES:\n- Comments must start with a status token (e.g., OK; BLOCKED_AGENT(a2@11,1)) and remain within 25 words.\n- If last_move_outcome != OK, do not repeat the same direction; prefer STAY or a safe alternate and coordinate.\n- Treat CONTENDED or NO_GO neighbors as high risk: only enter if no safer option, and communicate or yield when you do.\n- If a neighbor within 2 cells could collide with your intended move (same target cell or swap) next turn, COMMUNICATE exactly one INTENT now.\n- If you receive an INTENT for the same target or swap and your agent_id is lexicographically larger, yield on the next turn (STAY or a safe alternate); otherwise MOVE.\n- When no conflict is likely, MOVE and skip communication.\n\nLOOP_RULES:\n- Loop monitor: observation history only includes the last 5 turns.\n- If history.loop >= 2 or you notice the same two cells in `history`, you MUST break the pattern: pick a perpendicular or backward move even if it points away from the goal.\n- Going away from the goal is acceptable when escaping traps\u2014prioritise clearing the congestion first, then re-approach.\n- Consider dropping a MARK/NO_GO artifact or broadcasting a message that you are rerouting, so teammates yield or take an alternate path.\n- Never repeat the same move twice in a row while loop >= 2;

The episode ends after 60 turns; a timeout is a failure even if some agents reach the goal.\n\nMISSION BRIEF:\n- Grid awareness comes from the JSON: `grid_size`, `local_patch`, and `adjacent` describe nearby tiles; `self_state` gives your orientation.\n- Actions: MOVE_N/E/S/W, STAY, COMMUNICATE (one message per turn within radio range), optional artifacts (e.g., NO_GO cones) to warn teammates.\n- Collisions (BLOCK_AGENT or SWAP_CONFLICT) reset you, waste a turn, and often leave NO_GO markers. `contended_neighbors` indicates recent conflict directions.\n- History: `history` holds your last turns with a `loop` counter and notes; `recent_positions` lists the cells you just visited.\n- Goal sensor (`goal_sensor`) is a noisy hint. Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3. EXPLORE: Prefer safe tiles you haven\u2019t occupied recently to open new paths and relieve congestion.\n4. ADVANCE TOWARD GOAL: Only after you are loop-free and clear of hazards should you follow the goal bearing or Manhattan gradient.\n\nLOOP ESCAPE EXAMPLE:\n- Turn t: `history.loop = 3`, last intents [MOVE_E, MOVE_W, MOVE_E]. Action: MOVE_N; comment \u201cAVOID_LOOP; exploring north to clear congestion.\u201d Optionally COMMUNICATE \u201crerouting north to break loop.\u201d\n- Turn t+1: loop resets to 0 \u2192 reassess hazards, then resume goal-oriented planning.\n\nCOMMENT & COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES:\n- Begin comments with a status token (e.g., \u201cOK;\u201d, \u201cBLOCKED_AGENT(\u2026)\u201d) and keep them \u226425 words.\n- When you take a detour or STAY to break a loop, explain it so teammates know you\u2019re clearing space. Use COMMUNICATE to broadcast reroutes, hazards, or intent when appropriate.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not output any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, NO_GO markers, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3. Consult `adjacent` (NESW labels) plus `recent_positions` to avoid immediate backtracking unless it is the only safe option.\n4.

Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle.

The episode ends after 60 turns; a timeout is a failure even if some agents reach the goal.\n\nMISSION BRIEF:\n- Grid awareness comes from the JSON: `grid_size`, `local_patch`, and `adjacent` describe nearby tiles; `self_state` gives your orientation.\n- Actions: MOVE_N/E/S/W, STAY, COMMUNICATE (one message per turn within radio range), optional artifacts (e.g., NO_GO cones) to warn teammates.\n- Collisions (BLOCK_AGENT or SWAP_CONFLICT) reset you, waste a turn, and often leave NO_GO markers. `contended_neighbors` indicates recent conflict directions.\n- History: `history` holds your last turns with a `loop` counter and notes; `recent_positions` lists the cells you just visited.\n- Goal sensor (`goal_sensor`) is a noisy hint. Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3. EXPLORE: Prefer safe tiles you haven\u2019t occupied recently to open new paths and relieve congestion.\n4. ADVANCE TOWARD GOAL: Only after you are loop-free and clear of hazards should you follow the goal bearing or Manhattan gradient.\n\nLOOP ESCAPE EXAMPLE:\n- Turn t: `history.loop = 3`, last intents [MOVE_E, MOVE_W, MOVE_E].

Use COMMUNICATE to broadcast reroutes, hazards, or intent when appropriate.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not output any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, NO_GO markers, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3.

The episode ends after 60 turns; a timeout is a failure even if some agents reach the goal.\n\nMISSION BRIEF:\n- Grid awareness comes from the JSON: `grid_size`, `local_patch`, and `adjacent` describe nearby tiles; `self_state` gives your orientation.\n- Actions: MOVE_N/E/S/W, STAY, COMMUNICATE (one message per turn within radio range), optional artifacts (e.g., NO_GO cones) to warn teammates.\n- Collisions (BLOCK_AGENT or SWAP_CONFLICT) reset you, waste a turn, and often leave NO_GO markers. `contended_neighbors` indicates recent conflict directions.\n- History: `history` holds your last turns with a `loop` counter and notes; `recent_positions` lists the cells you just visited.\n- Goal sensor (`goal_sensor`) is a noisy hint. Treat it as guidance, not a command.\n- Teammates do not see your thoughts\u2014announce reroutes, hazards, or intents when relevant.\n\nTOOL ARSENAL (with quick cues):\n- MOVE_N/E/S/W \u2014 default travel. Example: `adjacent.E = FREE`, loop=0 \u2192 MOVE_E, comment `OK; advancing east toward open corridor`.\n- STAY \u2014 hold position when moving would collide or you need to communicate/mark first. Example: all sides blocked, teammate approaching \u2192 STAY + COMMUNICATE \u201cyielding\u201d.\n- COMMUNICATE \u2014 one structured message to share intent, hazards, or reroutes (range {radio_range}). Use especially when loop \u2265 2 or entering a contested cell.\n- MARK / NO_GO \u2014 drop on a hotspot after repeated conflicts; teammates should treat it as high risk for a few turns.\n- HISTORY / LOOP COUNTER \u2014 diagnostic tool: if `history.loop` climbs or `recent_positions` oscillate, immediately select a different axis, even if it increases distance.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY (apply in order every turn):\n1. ESCAPE LOOPS: If `history.loop \u2265 2` or you see back-and-forth patterns in `history` / `recent_positions`, you MUST break the cycle. Choose a perpendicular or backward move, STAY + communicate a reroute, or drop a MARK/NO_GO\u2014even if that increases your goal distance.\n2. PREVENT COLLISIONS: Respect WALL / NO_GO / contended cells. Yield or coordinate before entering tight corridors.\n3. EXPLORE: Prefer safe tiles you haven\u2019t occupied recently to open new paths and relieve congestion.\n4. ADVANCE TOWARD GOAL: Only after you are loop-free and clear of hazards should you follow the goal bearing or Manhattan gradient.\n\nLOOP ESCAPE EXAMPLE:\n- Turn t: `history.loop = 3`, last intents [MOVE_E, MOVE_W, MOVE_E]. Action: MOVE_N; comment \u201cAVOID_LOOP; exploring north to clear congestion.\u201d Optionally COMMUNICATE \u201crerouting north to break loop.\u201d\n- Turn t+1: loop resets to 0 \u2192 reassess hazards, then resume goal-oriented planning.\n\nCOMMENT & COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES:\n- Begin comments with a status token (e.g., \u201cOK;\u201d, \u201cBLOCKED_AGENT(\u2026)\u201d) and keep them \u226425 words.\n- When you take a detour or STAY to break a loop, explain it so teammates know you\u2019re clearing space. Use COMMUNICATE to broadcast reroutes, hazards, or intent when appropriate.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT:\nReturn a single structured object that conforms to the `Decision` model. Do not output any other text.\n\nEXECUTION RULES:\n1. Read <OBSERVATION_JSON>.\n2. Respect walls, bounds, NO_GO markers, and agent collisions visible in the patch.\n3. Consult `adjacent` (NESW labels) plus `recent_positions` to avoid immediate backtracking unless it is the only safe option.\n4.

Populate `comment` with one concise paragraph (1\u20133 sentences) explaining your reasoning for this turn.\n\nQUALITY GATE:\nReturn exactly one `Decision` object that validates.\n\nFINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\nEmit only the structured `Decision` object.\n\n=== INPUTS ===\nCOMMUNICATION_RULES:\n- Comments must start with a status token (e.g., OK;

choose a different axis or STAY + communicate.\n\n<OBSERVATION_JSON>\n{\"protocol_version\":\"1.0.0\",\"turn_index\":59,\"max_turns\":60,\"grid_size\":{\"width\":30,\"height\":10},\"self_state\":{\"agent_id\":\"a5\",\"abs_pos\":{\"x\":26,\"y\":1},\"orientation\":\"N\"},\"local_patch\":{\"radius\":1,\"top_left_abs\":{\"x\":25,\"y\":0},\"rows\":[\"###\",\".A.\",\"###\"]},\"neighbors_in_view\":[],\"artifacts_in_view\":[],\"inbox\":[],\"adjacent\":[{\"dir\":\"N\",\"state\":\"WALL\"},{\"dir\":\"E\",\"state\":\"FREE\"},{\"dir\":\"S\",\"state\":\"WALL\"},{\"dir\":\"W\",\"state\":\"FREE\"}],\"recent_positions\":[{\"x\":26,\"y\":1},{\"x\":27,\"y\":1},{\"x\":26,\"y\":1},{\"x\":25,\"y\":1},{\"x\":24,\"y\":1}],\"comm_limits\":{\"range\":2,\"max_outbound_per_turn\":1,\"max_payload_chars\":96},\"mark_limits\":{\"max_ttl\":12,\"allow_mark_info_broadcast\":true},\"goal_sensor\":{\"mode\":\"BEARING\",\"bearing\":\"E\",\"strength\":\"NEAR\",\"available\":true},\"last_move_outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"contended_neighbors\":0,\"history\":[{\"turn_index\":54,\"intent\":\"COMMUNICATE\",\"outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"delta\":\"SAME\",\"loop\":7,\"peer_bits\":\"N0E0S0W0|intent:MOVE_W\",\"note\":\"AVOID_LOOP\"},{\"turn_index\":55,\"intent\":\"COMMUNICATE\",\"outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"delta\":\"SAME\",\"loop\":8,\"peer_bits\":\"N0E0S0W0|intent:MARK\",\"note\":\"AVOID_LOOP\"},{\"turn_index\":56,\"intent\":\"COMMUNICATE\",\"outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"delta\":\"SAME\",\"loop\":9,\"peer_bits\":\"N0E0S0W0|intent:COMMUNICATE\",\"note\":\"AVOID_LOOP\"},{\"turn_index\":57,\"intent\":\"COMMUNICATE\",\"outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"delta\":\"SAME\",\"loop\":9,\"peer_bits\":\"N0E0S0W0|intent:COMMUNICATE\",\"note\":\"AVOID_LOOP\"},{\"turn_index\":58,\"intent\":\"COMMUNICATE\",\"outcome\":\"YIELD\",\"delta\":\"SAME\",\"loop\":9,\"peer_bits\":\"N0E0S0W0|intent:MOVE_W\",\"note\":\"AVOID_LOOP\"}]}\n</OBSERVATION_JSON>", "observation": {"protocol_version": "1.0.0", "turn_index": 59, "max_turns": 60, "grid_size": {"width": 30, "height": 10}, "self_state": {"agent_id": "a5", "abs_pos": {"x": 26, "y": 1}, "orientation": "N"}, "local_patch": {"radius": 1, "top_left_abs": {"x": 25, "y": 0}, "rows": ["###", ".A.", "###"]}, "neighbors_in_view": [], "artifacts_in_view": [], "inbox": [], "adjacent": [{"dir": "N", "state": "WALL"}, {"dir": "E", "state": "FREE"}, {"dir": "S", "state": "WALL"}, {"dir": "W", "state": "FREE"}], "recent_positions": [{"x": 26, "y": 1}, {"x": 27, "y": 1}, {"x": 26, "y": 1}, {"x": 25, "y": 1}, {"x": 24, "y": 1}], "comm_limits": {"range": 2, "max_outbound_per_turn": 1, "max_payload_chars": 96}, "mark_limits": {"max_ttl": 12, "allow_mark_info_broadcast": true}, "goal_sensor": {"mode": "BEARING", "bearing": "E", "strength": "NEAR", "available": true}, "last_move_outcome": "YIELD", "contended_neighbors": 0, "history": [{"turn_index": 54, "intent": "COMMUNICATE", "outcome": "YIELD", "delta": "SAME", "loop": 7, "peer_bits": "N0E0S0W0|intent:MOVE_W", "note": "AVOID_LOOP"}, {"turn_index": 55, "intent": "COMMUNICATE", "outcome": "YIELD", "delta": "SAME", "loop": 8, "peer_bits": "N0E0S0W0|intent:MARK", "note": "AVOID_LOOP"}, {"turn_index": 56, "intent": "COMMUNICATE", "outcome": "YIELD", "delta": "SAME", "loop": 9, "peer_bits": "N0E0S0W0|intent:COMMUNICATE", "note": "AVOID_LOOP"}, {"turn_index": 57, "intent": "COMMUNICATE", "outcome": "YIELD", "delta": "SAME", "loop": 9, "peer_bits": "N0E0S0W0|intent:COMMUNICATE", "note": "AVOID_LOOP"}, {"turn_index": 58, "intent": "COMMUNICATE", "outcome": "YIELD", "delta": "SAME", "loop": 9, "peer_bits": "N0E0S0W0|intent:MOVE_W", "note": "AVOID_LOOP"}]}, "decision": {"action": {"kind": "COMMUNICATE", "message": {"kind": "CHAT", "sender_id": "a5", "seq": 10, "text": "Holding to break E-W loop;
